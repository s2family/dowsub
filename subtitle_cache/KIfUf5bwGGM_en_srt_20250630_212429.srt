00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,230
Hey guys, tonight we begin with the delightfully dysfunctional world of the

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,240
delightfully dysfunctional world of the

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,030
delightfully dysfunctional world of the ancient Greek gods. A pantheon so

5
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
ancient Greek gods. A pantheon so

6
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,350
ancient Greek gods. A pantheon so powerful, so dramatic, and so

7
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
powerful, so dramatic, and so

8
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,749
powerful, so dramatic, and so emotionally unstable.

9
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
emotionally unstable.

10
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,830
emotionally unstable. So before you get comfortable, take a

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
where you're tuning in from and what

20
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,630
where you're tuning in from and what time it is for you. It's always

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
time it is for you. It's always

22
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,550

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
fascinating to see who's joining us from

24
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,790
fascinating to see who's joining us from around the world.

25
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
around the world.

26
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,589
around the world. Now, dim the lights. Maybe turn on a fan

27
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
Now, dim the lights. Maybe turn on a fan

28
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,069
Now, dim the lights. Maybe turn on a fan for that soft background hum. And let's

29
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
for that soft background hum. And let's

30
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,310
for that soft background hum. And let's ease into tonight's journey together.

31
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
ease into tonight's journey together.

32
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,630
ease into tonight's journey together. Let's begin with the big guy himself,

33
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
Let's begin with the big guy himself,

34
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,069
Let's begin with the big guy himself, Zeus, god of the sky, ruler of Olympus,

35
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
Zeus, god of the sky, ruler of Olympus,

36
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,310
Zeus, god of the sky, ruler of Olympus, and walking proof that absolute power

37
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
and walking proof that absolute power

38
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,150
and walking proof that absolute power absolutely fries your sense of

39
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
absolutely fries your sense of

40
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,910
absolutely fries your sense of boundaries.

41
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
boundaries.

42
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,069
boundaries. Zeus was the youngest son of Cronis and

43
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
Zeus was the youngest son of Cronis and

44
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,110
Zeus was the youngest son of Cronis and Ria. His dad, like all great fathers,

45
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
Ria. His dad, like all great fathers,

46
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,869
Ria. His dad, like all great fathers, had a habit of swallowing his children

47
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
had a habit of swallowing his children

48
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,709
had a habit of swallowing his children whole to prevent them from overthrowing

49
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
whole to prevent them from overthrowing

50
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,830
whole to prevent them from overthrowing him. romantic.

51
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
him. romantic.

52
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,150
him. romantic. Fortunately, Ria saved baby Zeus by

53
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
Fortunately, Ria saved baby Zeus by

54
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,590
Fortunately, Ria saved baby Zeus by tricking Cronis with a rock in a

55
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
tricking Cronis with a rock in a

56
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,750
tricking Cronis with a rock in a blanket, which tells you a lot about how

57
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
blanket, which tells you a lot about how

58
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,469
blanket, which tells you a lot about how closely this guy paid attention. Once

59
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
closely this guy paid attention. Once

60
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,789
closely this guy paid attention. Once Zeus grew up, he led a divine rebellion

61
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
Zeus grew up, he led a divine rebellion

62
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,030
Zeus grew up, he led a divine rebellion against Cronis, sliced open his father's

63
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
against Cronis, sliced open his father's

64
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,429
against Cronis, sliced open his father's stomach, Freud would have a field day,

65
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
stomach, Freud would have a field day,

66
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,030
stomach, Freud would have a field day, and freed his siblings, Poseidon, Hades,

67
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
and freed his siblings, Poseidon, Hades,

68
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,749
and freed his siblings, Poseidon, Hades, Hia, Hestia, and Deita. Boom. The

69
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
Hia, Hestia, and Deita. Boom. The

70
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,950
Hia, Hestia, and Deita. Boom. The original dysfunctional family was born.

71
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
original dysfunctional family was born.

72
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,870
original dysfunctional family was born. After the gods won the war against the

73
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
After the gods won the war against the

74
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,469
After the gods won the war against the titans, Zeus became king. He ruled the

75
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
titans, Zeus became king. He ruled the

76
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,390
titans, Zeus became king. He ruled the heavens, controlled thunder and

77
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
heavens, controlled thunder and

78
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,469
heavens, controlled thunder and lightning, and was in charge of cosmic

79
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
lightning, and was in charge of cosmic

80
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,429
lightning, and was in charge of cosmic order, justice, and oaths. In theory,

81
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
order, justice, and oaths. In theory,

82
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,109
order, justice, and oaths. In theory, that is. In practice, Zeus spent most of

83
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
that is. In practice, Zeus spent most of

84
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,190
that is. In practice, Zeus spent most of his time transforming into various

85
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
his time transforming into various

86
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,030
his time transforming into various animals and seducing anything with a

87
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
animals and seducing anything with a

88
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,990
animals and seducing anything with a pulse. Swans, bulls, eagles, golden

89
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
pulse. Swans, bulls, eagles, golden

90
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,469
pulse. Swans, bulls, eagles, golden mist. The man had no chill and no

91
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
mist. The man had no chill and no

92
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,190
mist. The man had no chill and no consistent moral code. Imagine your

93
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
consistent moral code. Imagine your

94
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,950
consistent moral code. Imagine your country's Supreme Court justice turning

95
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
country's Supreme Court justice turning

96
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,270
country's Supreme Court justice turning into a goose to flirt with civilians.

97
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
into a goose to flirt with civilians.

98
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,469
into a goose to flirt with civilians. That's Zeus, but with more lightning.

99
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
That's Zeus, but with more lightning.

100
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,149
That's Zeus, but with more lightning. His love life was an open- source

101
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
His love life was an open- source

102
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,109
His love life was an open- source disaster. He married his sister, Hia,

103
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
disaster. He married his sister, Hia,

104
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,550
disaster. He married his sister, Hia, which went about as well as you'd

105
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
which went about as well as you'd

106
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,750
which went about as well as you'd expect. He had dozens of affairs with

107
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
expect. He had dozens of affairs with

108
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,030
expect. He had dozens of affairs with goddesses, nymphs, mortals, and probably

109
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
goddesses, nymphs, mortals, and probably

110
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,589
goddesses, nymphs, mortals, and probably one or two house plants.

111
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
one or two house plants.

112
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,390
one or two house plants. The result, an overwhelming number of

113
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
The result, an overwhelming number of

114
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,630
The result, an overwhelming number of demigod children, many of whom had

115
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
demigod children, many of whom had

116
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,110
demigod children, many of whom had serious parental abandonment issues and

117
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
serious parental abandonment issues and

118
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,150
serious parental abandonment issues and accidentally founded entire mythologies.

119
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
accidentally founded entire mythologies.

120
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,390
accidentally founded entire mythologies. But despite all that, Zeus wasn't

121
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
But despite all that, Zeus wasn't

122
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,630
But despite all that, Zeus wasn't entirely chaotic. When he wasn't

123
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
entirely chaotic. When he wasn't

124
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,390
entirely chaotic. When he wasn't cheating or chucking lightning bolts at

125
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
cheating or chucking lightning bolts at

126
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,910
cheating or chucking lightning bolts at mortals who didn't offer proper

127
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
mortals who didn't offer proper

128
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,710
mortals who didn't offer proper sacrifices, he did act as the cosmic

129
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
sacrifices, he did act as the cosmic

130
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,470
sacrifices, he did act as the cosmic referee. He enforced oaths, upheld law,

131
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
referee. He enforced oaths, upheld law,

132
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,229
referee. He enforced oaths, upheld law, and occasionally punished people for

133
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
and occasionally punished people for

134
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,390
and occasionally punished people for being more arrogant than he was, which

135
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
being more arrogant than he was, which

136
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,190
being more arrogant than he was, which frankly took effort.

137
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
frankly took effort.

138
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,589
frankly took effort. Zeus was respected, feared, and

139
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
Zeus was respected, feared, and

140
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,589
Zeus was respected, feared, and constantly causing PR nightmares for

141
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
constantly causing PR nightmares for

142
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,949
constantly causing PR nightmares for Olympus. He had power, presence, and

143
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
Olympus. He had power, presence, and

144
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,430
Olympus. He had power, presence, and zero understanding of personal space. He

145
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
zero understanding of personal space. He

146
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,589
zero understanding of personal space. He was both protector and predator, judge,

147
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
was both protector and predator, judge,

148
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,509
was both protector and predator, judge, and joke, the ultimate divine

149
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
and joke, the ultimate divine

150
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,430
and joke, the ultimate divine contradiction.

151
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
contradiction.

152
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,110
contradiction. Hia is technically the goddess of

153
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
Hia is technically the goddess of

154
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,750
Hia is technically the goddess of marriage, family, and childbirth, which

155
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
marriage, family, and childbirth, which

156
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,670
marriage, family, and childbirth, which is ironic because her own marriage is an

157
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
is ironic because her own marriage is an

158
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,509
is ironic because her own marriage is an absolute dumpster fire in a golden

159
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
absolute dumpster fire in a golden

160
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,110
absolute dumpster fire in a golden chariot. She's Zeus's wife, also his

161
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
chariot. She's Zeus's wife, also his

162
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,350
chariot. She's Zeus's wife, also his sister, because, you know, mythology.

163
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
sister, because, you know, mythology.

164
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,790
sister, because, you know, mythology. Their wedding was supposed to be the

165
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
Their wedding was supposed to be the

166
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,229
Their wedding was supposed to be the divine ideal of sacred union. Instead,

167
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
divine ideal of sacred union. Instead,

168
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,229
divine ideal of sacred union. Instead, it turned into a centuries long soap

169
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
it turned into a centuries long soap

170
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,949
it turned into a centuries long soap opera filled with infidelity, revenge,

171
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
opera filled with infidelity, revenge,

172

opera filled with infidelity, revenge, and a shocking number of people turned

and a shocking number of people turned

174
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,949
and a shocking number of people turned into animals or trees or stone.

175
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
into animals or trees or stone.

176
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,589
into animals or trees or stone. Hera is powerful, the undisputed queen

177
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
Hera is powerful, the undisputed queen

178
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,229
Hera is powerful, the undisputed queen of the gods. But her power mostly

179
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
of the gods. But her power mostly

180
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,390
of the gods. But her power mostly expresses itself in one very specific

00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
expresses itself in one very specific

182
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,750
expresses itself in one very specific way. Vengeance.

183
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
way. Vengeance.

184
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,390
way. Vengeance. Not on Zeus, of course. No, that would

00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
Not on Zeus, of course. No, that would

186
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,670
Not on Zeus, of course. No, that would be too simple. Here's Fury is laser

189
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
focused on the women Zeus seduces, or

190
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,550
focused on the women Zeus seduces, or let's be honest, outright kidnaps and

let's be honest, outright kidnaps and

192
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,030
let's be honest, outright kidnaps and their unfortunate children. She once

their unfortunate children. She once

194
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,270
their unfortunate children. She once turned a woman into a cow, cursed

195
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
turned a woman into a cow, cursed

196
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,429
turned a woman into a cow, cursed another to only speak in echoes, and in

another to only speak in echoes, and in

198
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,990
another to only speak in echoes, and in one particularly cruel moment tried to

one particularly cruel moment tried to

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,750
one particularly cruel moment tried to kill baby Hercules with a pair of

kill baby Hercules with a pair of

202
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,429
kill baby Hercules with a pair of serpents. That was literally his baby.

203
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
serpents. That was literally his baby.

204
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,110
serpents. That was literally his baby. Hers, no. His still? Nope. It's hard to

205
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
Hers, no. His still? Nope. It's hard to

206
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,670
Hers, no. His still? Nope. It's hard to blame her entirely. Imagine being the

00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
blame her entirely. Imagine being the

208
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,189
blame her entirely. Imagine being the goddess of marriage while your husband

209
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
goddess of marriage while your husband

210
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,790
goddess of marriage while your husband is out here inventing new forms of

00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
animal-based flirtation. But still, her

214
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,790
animal-based flirtation. But still, her divine coping mechanisms often included

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
punishments.

220
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,909
punishments. Therapy wasn't a thing in ancient

Therapy wasn't a thing in ancient

222
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,230
Therapy wasn't a thing in ancient Greece, so revenge was the next best

Greece, so revenge was the next best

224
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,749
Greece, so revenge was the next best option. Yet, despite all that, Hia

00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
option. Yet, despite all that, Hia

226
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,469
option. Yet, despite all that, Hia wasn't just a celestial grudgeholder.

227
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
wasn't just a celestial grudgeholder.

228
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,110
wasn't just a celestial grudgeholder. She also protected women in childbirth,

229
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
She also protected women in childbirth,

She also protected women in childbirth, upheld the sanctity of marriage

232
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,909
upheld the sanctity of marriage theoretically, and punished oaths broken

theoretically, and punished oaths broken

234
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,430
theoretically, and punished oaths broken by mortals. She had temples, priests,

235
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
by mortals. She had temples, priests,

236
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,469
by mortals. She had temples, priests, and a devoted cult. Following cities

237
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
and a devoted cult. Following cities

238
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,110
and a devoted cult. Following cities like Argos and Samos worshiped her as a

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
like Argos and Samos worshiped her as a

240
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,909
like Argos and Samos worshiped her as a major force of divine order.

241
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
major force of divine order.

242
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,390
major force of divine order. In short, Ha was the goddess you prayed

243
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
In short, Ha was the goddess you prayed

244
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,790
In short, Ha was the goddess you prayed to when your husband was faithful and

245
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
to when your husband was faithful and

246
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,629
to when your husband was faithful and the one who probably sent a plague when

247
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
the one who probably sent a plague when

248
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,310
the one who probably sent a plague when he wasn't.

249
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
he wasn't.

250
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,950
he wasn't. She's a fascinating paradox, the

251
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
She's a fascinating paradox, the

252
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,350
She's a fascinating paradox, the embodiment of female dignity and power

253
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
embodiment of female dignity and power

254
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,590
embodiment of female dignity and power in a system that constantly humiliated

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,749
her. Her story isn't just about jealousy.

Her story isn't just about jealousy.

260
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,430
Her story isn't just about jealousy. It's about a woman who was supposed to

It's about a woman who was supposed to

It's about a woman who was supposed to symbolize unity while holding Olympus

fury. Poseidon was the god of the sea,

268
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,870
fury. Poseidon was the god of the sea, earthquakes, storms, and for some

reason, horses.

272
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,350
reason, horses. because nothing says ocean god like a

herd of galloping stallions.

276
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,230

But hey, mythology, he was one of the

278
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,110
But hey, mythology, he was one of the three main brothers. Zeus got the sky,

279
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
three main brothers. Zeus got the sky,

280
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,590
three main brothers. Zeus got the sky, Hades got the underworld, and Poseidon

281
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
Hades got the underworld, and Poseidon

282
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,710
Hades got the underworld, and Poseidon got everything wet, which suited him

283

got everything wet, which suited him

284
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,189
got everything wet, which suited him just fine. He ruled over the vast

285
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
just fine. He ruled over the vast

286
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,510

massive trident, not just a pointy fork,

292
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,189
massive trident, not just a pointy fork, but a three-pronged divine rage stick

00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
but a three-pronged divine rage stick

294
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,469

capable of leveling entire cities.

296
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,710
capable of leveling entire cities. Poseidon was revered and feared in equal

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
Poseidon was revered and feared in equal

298
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,430
Poseidon was revered and feared in equal measure. Sailors prayed to him for safe

Citybuilders asked his permission before putting anything too close to the

property by accident.

310
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,950
property by accident. But let's be honest, Poseidon had

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
But let's be honest, Poseidon had

312
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,550
But let's be honest, Poseidon had issues. Big crashing tidal wavesized

313
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
issues. Big crashing tidal wavesized

314
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,270

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,230
emotional issues. He was the classic unpredictable uncle. Sometimes generous,

317
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
unpredictable uncle. Sometimes generous,

318
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,390
unpredictable uncle. Sometimes generous, sometimes devastating, always a bit

319
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
sometimes devastating, always a bit

320
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,390
sometimes devastating, always a bit salty. One moment he's creating islands,

321
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
salty. One moment he's creating islands,

322
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,390
salty. One moment he's creating islands, the next he's flooding your crops

the next he's flooding your crops because someone forgot to thank him

325

because someone forgot to thank him

326
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,469
because someone forgot to thank him during a sacrificial goat ceremony. He

327
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
during a sacrificial goat ceremony. He

328
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,469
during a sacrificial goat ceremony. He once struck the ground so hard with his

once struck the ground so hard with his

330
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,430
once struck the ground so hard with his trident that he caused an earthquake

331
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
trident that he caused an earthquake

332
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,029
trident that he caused an earthquake just because he lost a city naming

00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
just because he lost a city naming

334
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,029
just because he lost a city naming contest to Athena.

335
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
contest to Athena.

336
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,629
contest to Athena. Seriously,

00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
Seriously,

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,950
Seriously, she gave Athens an olive tree. He

339
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
she gave Athens an olive tree. He

340
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,430
she gave Athens an olive tree. He offered a saltwater spring. The people

341
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
offered a saltwater spring. The people

342
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,950
offered a saltwater spring. The people chose olives. He chose vengeance. That's

343
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
chose olives. He chose vengeance. That's

344
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,909
chose olives. He chose vengeance. That's Poseidon in a nutshell. He also had a

345
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
Poseidon in a nutshell. He also had a

346
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,309
Poseidon in a nutshell. He also had a rather complicated love life. There were

347
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
rather complicated love life. There were

348
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,790
rather complicated love life. There were nymphs, mortals, even one incident

349
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
nymphs, mortals, even one incident

350
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,189
nymphs, mortals, even one incident involving Medusa, which ended with her

351
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
involving Medusa, which ended with her

352
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,350
involving Medusa, which ended with her getting snake hair and a monster label

353
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
getting snake hair and a monster label

354
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,870
getting snake hair and a monster label and him walking away without

355
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
and him walking away without

356
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,629
and him walking away without consequences.

357
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
consequences.

358
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,390
consequences. Classic.

359
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
Classic.

360
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,790
Classic. Despite all that, Poseidon wasn't just a

361
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
Despite all that, Poseidon wasn't just a

362
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,950
Despite all that, Poseidon wasn't just a stormy brute. He was a protector of

363
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
stormy brute. He was a protector of

364
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,309
stormy brute. He was a protector of seafarers, a builder of cities, and in

365
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
seafarers, a builder of cities, and in

366
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,110
seafarers, a builder of cities, and in his calmer moments, a god of prosperity

367
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
his calmer moments, a god of prosperity

368
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,110
his calmer moments, a god of prosperity and fertility.

369
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
and fertility.

370
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,909
and fertility. He was essential to ancient Greek life,

371
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
He was essential to ancient Greek life,

372
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,990
He was essential to ancient Greek life, especially for a culture so dependent on

373
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
especially for a culture so dependent on

374
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,430
especially for a culture so dependent on the sea. But like the ocean itself, he

375
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
the sea. But like the ocean itself, he

376
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,670
the sea. But like the ocean itself, he was always one storm away from reminding

377
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
was always one storm away from reminding

378
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,510
was always one storm away from reminding everyone who was really in charge. Hades

379
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
everyone who was really in charge. Hades

380
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,150
everyone who was really in charge. Hades is the god of the underworld. Not hell

381
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
is the god of the underworld. Not hell

382
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,869
is the god of the underworld. Not hell exactly, but a vast, gloomy realm where

383
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
exactly, but a vast, gloomy realm where

384
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,110
exactly, but a vast, gloomy realm where all souls eventually clock out for

385
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
all souls eventually clock out for

386
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,749
all souls eventually clock out for eternity. Contrary to modern pop

387
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
eternity. Contrary to modern pop

388
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,550
eternity. Contrary to modern pop culture, Hades wasn't evil. He wasn't

389
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
culture, Hades wasn't evil. He wasn't

390
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,909
culture, Hades wasn't evil. He wasn't even particularly cruel. He was just

391
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
even particularly cruel. He was just

392
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,670
even particularly cruel. He was just incredibly tired of everyone.

393
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
incredibly tired of everyone.

394
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,909
incredibly tired of everyone. While Zeus got the sky and Poseidon got

395
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
While Zeus got the sky and Poseidon got

396
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,029
While Zeus got the sky and Poseidon got the seas, Hades drew the short straw and

397
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
the seas, Hades drew the short straw and

398
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,950
the seas, Hades drew the short straw and got stuck managing the ancient Greek

399
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
got stuck managing the ancient Greek

400
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,110
got stuck managing the ancient Greek version of customer service for the

401
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
version of customer service for the

402
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,950
version of customer service for the dead. For eternity in darkness,

403
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
dead. For eternity in darkness,

404
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,990
dead. For eternity in darkness, surrounded by whailing, Hades ruled the

405
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
surrounded by whailing, Hades ruled the

406
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,749
surrounded by whailing, Hades ruled the underworld with a quiet, brooding

407
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
underworld with a quiet, brooding

408
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,870
underworld with a quiet, brooding authority. He wasn't flashy. He wasn't

409
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
authority. He wasn't flashy. He wasn't

410
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,350
authority. He wasn't flashy. He wasn't loud. He didn't throw lightning or crash

411
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
loud. He didn't throw lightning or crash

412
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,430
loud. He didn't throw lightning or crash weddings. He just showed up to work

413
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
weddings. He just showed up to work

414
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,750
weddings. He just showed up to work every day managing the logistics of

415
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
every day managing the logistics of

416
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,149
every day managing the logistics of eternity and making sure souls didn't

417
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
eternity and making sure souls didn't

418
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,630
eternity and making sure souls didn't sneak out the back. The ultimate middle

419
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
sneak out the back. The ultimate middle

420
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,670
sneak out the back. The ultimate middle manager. His domain was called Hades,

421
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
manager. His domain was called Hades,

422
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,310
manager. His domain was called Hades, too, because apparently naming a kingdom

423
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
too, because apparently naming a kingdom

424
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,470
too, because apparently naming a kingdom after yourself wasn't a red flag back

425
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
after yourself wasn't a red flag back

426
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,190
after yourself wasn't a red flag back then. It had sections for the heroic

427
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
then. It had sections for the heroic

428
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,230
then. It had sections for the heroic Elysium, the average Asphodel, and the

429
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
Elysium, the average Asphodel, and the

430
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,430
Elysium, the average Asphodel, and the truly awful Tartarus, ancient Greece's

431
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
truly awful Tartarus, ancient Greece's

432
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,910
truly awful Tartarus, ancient Greece's version of a very long detention. And

433
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
version of a very long detention. And

434
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,150
version of a very long detention. And guess who had to oversee all of it?

435
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
guess who had to oversee all of it?

436
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,590
guess who had to oversee all of it? That's right, Hades, the Goth workaholic

437
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
That's right, Hades, the Goth workaholic

438
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,190
That's right, Hades, the Goth workaholic of the gods. Now, about Pesphanany. Yes,

439
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
of the gods. Now, about Pesphanany. Yes,

440
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,230
of the gods. Now, about Pesphanany. Yes, he kidnapped her. Not great. Definitely

441
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
he kidnapped her. Not great. Definitely

442
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,269
he kidnapped her. Not great. Definitely problematic. But also, and Greek

443
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
problematic. But also, and Greek

444
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,630
problematic. But also, and Greek mythology is nothing if not

445
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
mythology is nothing if not

446
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,350
mythology is nothing if not inconsistent, they actually grew into a

447
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
inconsistent, they actually grew into a

448
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,389
inconsistent, they actually grew into a functional, weirdly stable marriage. She

449
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
functional, weirdly stable marriage. She

450
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,230
functional, weirdly stable marriage. She spent half the year with him, bringing

451
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
spent half the year with him, bringing

452
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,150
spent half the year with him, bringing life to the underworld and the other

453
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
life to the underworld and the other

454
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,670
life to the underworld and the other half on Earth, causing spring. It's less

455
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
half on Earth, causing spring. It's less

456
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,389
half on Earth, causing spring. It's less romance, more mythological time share.

457
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
romance, more mythological time share.

458
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,590
romance, more mythological time share. Hades was also the original pet dad. His

459
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
Hades was also the original pet dad. His

460
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,310
Hades was also the original pet dad. His dog, Cerberus, had three heads, a

461
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
dog, Cerberus, had three heads, a

462
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,430
dog, Cerberus, had three heads, a temper, and zero obedience training.

463
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
temper, and zero obedience training.

464
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,509
temper, and zero obedience training. But he kept souls in line mostly. Unlike

465
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
But he kept souls in line mostly. Unlike

466
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,230
But he kept souls in line mostly. Unlike his brothers, Hades didn't cheat, didn't

467
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
his brothers, Hades didn't cheat, didn't

468
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,509
his brothers, Hades didn't cheat, didn't rage, and didn't crave the spotlight.

469
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
rage, and didn't crave the spotlight.

470
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,190
rage, and didn't crave the spotlight. That's probably why ancient Greeks

471
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
That's probably why ancient Greeks

472
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,750
That's probably why ancient Greeks rarely built temples for him. They were

473
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
rarely built temples for him. They were

474
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,230
rarely built temples for him. They were terrified of attracting his attention.

475
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
terrified of attracting his attention.

476
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,310
terrified of attracting his attention. He was the quiet, grim uncle you didn't

477
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
He was the quiet, grim uncle you didn't

478
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,630
He was the quiet, grim uncle you didn't invite to the party, but still respected

479
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
invite to the party, but still respected

480
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,430
invite to the party, but still respected from a safe, polite distance.

481
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
from a safe, polite distance.

482
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,910
from a safe, polite distance. Athena is the goddess of wisdom, war

483
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
Athena is the goddess of wisdom, war

484
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,790
Athena is the goddess of wisdom, war strategy, handiccrafts, and staying 10

485
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
strategy, handiccrafts, and staying 10

486
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,550
strategy, handiccrafts, and staying 10 steps ahead of everyone without breaking

487
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
steps ahead of everyone without breaking

488
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,110
steps ahead of everyone without breaking a sweat. She's basically the divine

489
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
a sweat. She's basically the divine

490
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,190
a sweat. She's basically the divine embodiment of logic in a world full of

491
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
embodiment of logic in a world full of

492
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,750
embodiment of logic in a world full of emotional wrecks with lightning bolts.

493
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
emotional wrecks with lightning bolts.

494
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,829
emotional wrecks with lightning bolts. Her birth alone is enough to give Freud

495
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
Her birth alone is enough to give Freud

496
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,870
Her birth alone is enough to give Freud nightmares. Zeus, after swallowing her

497
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
nightmares. Zeus, after swallowing her

498
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,710
nightmares. Zeus, after swallowing her pregnant mother, Matis, because

499
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
pregnant mother, Matis, because

500
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,630
pregnant mother, Matis, because prophecy, of course, developed a

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
prophecy, of course, developed a

502
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,509
prophecy, of course, developed a splitting headache. Instead of aspirin,

503
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
splitting headache. Instead of aspirin,

504
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,069
splitting headache. Instead of aspirin, he got a hammer to the skull. And out

505
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
he got a hammer to the skull. And out

506
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,710
he got a hammer to the skull. And out popped Athena, fully grown, fully

507
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
popped Athena, fully grown, fully

508
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,710
popped Athena, fully grown, fully armored, and fully unimpressed with

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
armored, and fully unimpressed with

510
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,829
armored, and fully unimpressed with everyone. From day one, Athena made it

511
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
everyone. From day one, Athena made it

512
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,470
everyone. From day one, Athena made it clear she was not here for nonsense.

513
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
clear she was not here for nonsense.

514
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,949
clear she was not here for nonsense. Unlike her warhappy brother, Aries,

515
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
Unlike her warhappy brother, Aries,

516
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,630
Unlike her warhappy brother, Aries, Athena viewed conflict like a

517
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
Athena viewed conflict like a

518
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,030
Athena viewed conflict like a chessboard, something to be analyzed,

519
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
chessboard, something to be analyzed,

520
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,949
chessboard, something to be analyzed, controlled, and won with minimal

521
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
controlled, and won with minimal

522
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,389
controlled, and won with minimal shouting and maximum efficiency. If Aris

523
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
shouting and maximum efficiency. If Aris

524
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,870
shouting and maximum efficiency. If Aris was a chaotic bar fight, Athena was a

525
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
was a chaotic bar fight, Athena was a

526
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,590
was a chaotic bar fight, Athena was a war room with spreadsheets. She's also

527
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
war room with spreadsheets. She's also

528
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,829
war room with spreadsheets. She's also the goddess of crafts, which might seem

529
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
the goddess of crafts, which might seem

530
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,829
the goddess of crafts, which might seem out of place until you realize weaving

531
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
out of place until you realize weaving

532
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,710
out of place until you realize weaving in her hands was a battlefield.

533
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
in her hands was a battlefield.

534
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,269
in her hands was a battlefield. Just ask Arachnne, a mortal who dared

535
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
Just ask Arachnne, a mortal who dared

536
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,990
Just ask Arachnne, a mortal who dared challenge Athena to a weaving contest.

537
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
challenge Athena to a weaving contest.

538
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,949
challenge Athena to a weaving contest. Arachnne won technically, but was then

539
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
Arachnne won technically, but was then

540
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,710
Arachnne won technically, but was then turned into a spider for being a little

541
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
turned into a spider for being a little

542
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,150
turned into a spider for being a little too talented. Moral of the story, be

543
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
too talented. Moral of the story, be

544
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,630
too talented. Moral of the story, be humble or enjoy your new life in the

545
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
humble or enjoy your new life in the

546
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,190
humble or enjoy your new life in the corner of someone's ceiling.

547
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
corner of someone's ceiling.

548
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,150
corner of someone's ceiling. Athena stayed out of romance entirely.

549
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
Athena stayed out of romance entirely.

550
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,470
Athena stayed out of romance entirely. Unlike the rest of Olympus, she didn't

551
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
Unlike the rest of Olympus, she didn't

552
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,509
Unlike the rest of Olympus, she didn't seduce mortals, marry her brother, or

553
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
seduce mortals, marry her brother, or

554
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,310
seduce mortals, marry her brother, or transform into questionable animals. She

555
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
transform into questionable animals. She

556
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,630
transform into questionable animals. She simply had things to do. Cities to

557
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
simply had things to do. Cities to

558
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,509
simply had things to do. Cities to protect, heroes to advise, owls to

559
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
protect, heroes to advise, owls to

560
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,110
protect, heroes to advise, owls to raise.

561
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
raise.

562
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,910
raise. She guided Adysius home, helped Perseus

563
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:55,920
She guided Adysius home, helped Perseus

564
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,470
She guided Adysius home, helped Perseus behead Medusa, and probably edited the

565
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
behead Medusa, and probably edited the

566
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,110
behead Medusa, and probably edited the Iliad with a red pen.

567
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
Iliad with a red pen.

568
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,030
Iliad with a red pen. Athena is the goddess you'd want on your

569
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
Athena is the goddess you'd want on your

570
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,110
Athena is the goddess you'd want on your debate team, in your war council, or

571
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
debate team, in your war council, or

572
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,590
debate team, in your war council, or running your startup. She doesn't

573
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
running your startup. She doesn't

574
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,150
running your startup. She doesn't scream. She doesn't scheme. She simply

575
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
scream. She doesn't scheme. She simply

576
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,190
scream. She doesn't scheme. She simply outsmarts always.

577
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
outsmarts always.

578
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,430
outsmarts always. Aries was the Greek god of war,

579
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
Aries was the Greek god of war,

580
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,069
Aries was the Greek god of war, bloodshed, and punching first, thinking

581
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079
bloodshed, and punching first, thinking

582
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,470
bloodshed, and punching first, thinking never. If Athena was war with a

583
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
never. If Athena was war with a

584
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,629
never. If Athena was war with a blueprint, Aris was war with a

585
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
blueprint, Aris was war with a

586
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,829
blueprint, Aris was war with a sledgehammer and poor impulse control.

587
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
sledgehammer and poor impulse control.

588
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,470
sledgehammer and poor impulse control. He represented the brutal raw chaos of

589
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
He represented the brutal raw chaos of

590
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,870
He represented the brutal raw chaos of battle. The part where screaming men

591
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
battle. The part where screaming men

592
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,949
battle. The part where screaming men charged into each other and no one

593
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
charged into each other and no one

594
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,470
charged into each other and no one really knew what was happening except

595
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
really knew what was happening except

596
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,550
really knew what was happening except that things were on fire and someone

597
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
that things were on fire and someone

598
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,790
that things were on fire and someone just lost a helmet.

599
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
just lost a helmet.

600
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,069
just lost a helmet. In short, if Aries shows up, things are

601
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
In short, if Aries shows up, things are

602
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,790
In short, if Aries shows up, things are about to get loud, violent, and deeply

603
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
about to get loud, violent, and deeply

604
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,710
about to get loud, violent, and deeply disorganized.

605
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
disorganized.

606
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,230
disorganized. Personalitywise,

607
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
Personalitywise,

608
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,230
Personalitywise, he wasn't exactly Olympus's favorite

609
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
he wasn't exactly Olympus's favorite

610
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,870
he wasn't exactly Olympus's favorite guest. Even his fellow gods didn't like

611
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
guest. Even his fellow gods didn't like

612
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,990
guest. Even his fellow gods didn't like him. Zeus once called him the most

613
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
him. Zeus once called him the most

614
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,470
him. Zeus once called him the most hateful of all the gods. And you know

615
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
hateful of all the gods. And you know

616
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,150
hateful of all the gods. And you know you've messed up when Zeus is calling

617
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
you've messed up when Zeus is calling

618
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,350
you've messed up when Zeus is calling you a problem. Aries was arrogant,

619
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
you a problem. Aries was arrogant,

620
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,590
you a problem. Aries was arrogant, hotheaded, and about as subtle as a

621
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
hotheaded, and about as subtle as a

622
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,150
hotheaded, and about as subtle as a flaming chariot. He wasn't particularly

623
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
flaming chariot. He wasn't particularly

624
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,710
flaming chariot. He wasn't particularly respected either. The Greeks admired

625
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
respected either. The Greeks admired

626
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,590
respected either. The Greeks admired strategy, restraint, and cleverness,

627
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
strategy, restraint, and cleverness,

628
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,829
strategy, restraint, and cleverness, things aris consistently failed to bring

629
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
things aris consistently failed to bring

630
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,389
things aris consistently failed to bring to the table. He didn't win battles with

631
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
to the table. He didn't win battles with

632
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,990
to the table. He didn't win battles with tactics. He just stormed in swinging.

633
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
tactics. He just stormed in swinging.

634
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,389
tactics. He just stormed in swinging. That worked occasionally, but more often

635
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
That worked occasionally, but more often

636
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,030
That worked occasionally, but more often than not, it left a trail of dead bodies

637
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
than not, it left a trail of dead bodies

638
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,310
than not, it left a trail of dead bodies and deeply annoyed allies. That said,

639
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
and deeply annoyed allies. That said,

640
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,949
and deeply annoyed allies. That said, Aris was still terrifying. He was the

641
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
Aris was still terrifying. He was the

642
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,670
Aris was still terrifying. He was the god of fear, literally. His sons were

643
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
god of fear, literally. His sons were

644
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,629
god of fear, literally. His sons were named Phobos and Daimos, aka Panic and

645
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
named Phobos and Daimos, aka Panic and

646
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,870
named Phobos and Daimos, aka Panic and Terror, and he loved being in the thick

647
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
Terror, and he loved being in the thick

648
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,509
Terror, and he loved being in the thick of a brawl. He also had an affair with

649
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
of a brawl. He also had an affair with

650
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,990
of a brawl. He also had an affair with Aphroditi, which sounds romantic until

651
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
Aphroditi, which sounds romantic until

652
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,590
Aphroditi, which sounds romantic until you remember it ended with him getting

653
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
you remember it ended with him getting

654
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,430
you remember it ended with him getting caught in an invisible net by her

655
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
caught in an invisible net by her

656
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,310
caught in an invisible net by her husband, Histus, and laughed at by the

657
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
husband, Histus, and laughed at by the

658
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,509
husband, Histus, and laughed at by the entire pantheon. Ancient Greek tabloids

659
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
entire pantheon. Ancient Greek tabloids

660
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,389
entire pantheon. Ancient Greek tabloids had a field day. In Roman mythology,

661
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
had a field day. In Roman mythology,

662
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,030
had a field day. In Roman mythology, Aries got a makeover as Mars, more

663
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
Aries got a makeover as Mars, more

664
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,949
Aries got a makeover as Mars, more disciplined, more honorable, less

665
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
disciplined, more honorable, less

666
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,750
disciplined, more honorable, less sweaty. But in Greece, he stayed the

667
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
sweaty. But in Greece, he stayed the

668
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,910
sweaty. But in Greece, he stayed the chaotic, muscle-bound avatar of

669
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
chaotic, muscle-bound avatar of

670
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,750
chaotic, muscle-bound avatar of violence. Still, Ahri had his moments.

671
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
violence. Still, Ahri had his moments.

672
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,150
violence. Still, Ahri had his moments. In times of actual war, he was feared

673
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
In times of actual war, he was feared

674
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,430
In times of actual war, he was feared and revered. Warriors made sacrifices to

675
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
and revered. Warriors made sacrifices to

676
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,750
and revered. Warriors made sacrifices to him, hoping he'd bring them strength, or

677
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
him, hoping he'd bring them strength, or

678
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,629
him, hoping he'd bring them strength, or at least ignore them for a while. And

679
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
at least ignore them for a while. And

680
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,790
at least ignore them for a while. And when he wasn't breaking things, he did

681
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
when he wasn't breaking things, he did

682
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,710
when he wasn't breaking things, he did ride a cool chariot pulled by fireb

683
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
ride a cool chariot pulled by fireb

684
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,790
ride a cool chariot pulled by fireb breathing horses, which earns him at

685
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
breathing horses, which earns him at

686
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,350
breathing horses, which earns him at least one style point.

687
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
least one style point.

688
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,670
least one style point. Aphroditi was the goddess of love,

689
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
Aphroditi was the goddess of love,

690
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,550
Aphroditi was the goddess of love, beauty, desire, and romantic messes with

691
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
beauty, desire, and romantic messes with

692
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,350
beauty, desire, and romantic messes with extremely high body counts. If you've

693
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
extremely high body counts. If you've

694
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,509
extremely high body counts. If you've ever seen someone fall in love way too

695
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
ever seen someone fall in love way too

696
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,629
ever seen someone fall in love way too fast with exactly the wrong person,

697
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:44,639
fast with exactly the wrong person,

698
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,470
fast with exactly the wrong person, congratulations. You've witnessed

699
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
congratulations. You've witnessed

700
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,350
congratulations. You've witnessed Aphrodites divine influence.

701
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
Aphrodites divine influence.

702
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,350
Aphrodites divine influence. There are two origin stories for her,

703
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
There are two origin stories for her,

704
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,949
There are two origin stories for her, depending on how much trauma you can

705
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
depending on how much trauma you can

706
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,670
depending on how much trauma you can stomach. In one version, she's the

707
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
stomach. In one version, she's the

708
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,949
stomach. In one version, she's the daughter of Zeus and Dion. In the older

709
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
daughter of Zeus and Dion. In the older

710
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,670
daughter of Zeus and Dion. In the older and frankly much weirder version, she's

711
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
and frankly much weirder version, she's

712
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,430
and frankly much weirder version, she's born from the seafoam that formed when

713
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
born from the seafoam that formed when

714
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,750
born from the seafoam that formed when Cronis chopped off Uranus's uh godly

715
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
Cronis chopped off Uranus's uh godly

716
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,790
Cronis chopped off Uranus's uh godly equipment and tossed it into the ocean.

717
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
equipment and tossed it into the ocean.

718
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,710
equipment and tossed it into the ocean. And yes, that's probably the least

719
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
And yes, that's probably the least

720
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,389
And yes, that's probably the least romantic origin ever assigned to the

721
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
romantic origin ever assigned to the

722
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,430
romantic origin ever assigned to the goddess of romance. Aphrodite was so

723
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
goddess of romance. Aphrodite was so

724
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,590
goddess of romance. Aphrodite was so stunningly beautiful that mortals and

725
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
stunningly beautiful that mortals and

726
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,990
stunningly beautiful that mortals and gods alike basically lost their ability

727
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
gods alike basically lost their ability

728
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,629
gods alike basically lost their ability to make good decisions in her presence.

729
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
to make good decisions in her presence.

730
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,030
to make good decisions in her presence. She had an actual magical belt, the

731
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
She had an actual magical belt, the

732
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,350
She had an actual magical belt, the cestus, that made her irresistible to

733
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
cestus, that made her irresistible to

734
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,790
cestus, that made her irresistible to anyone, which, let's be honest, is a

735
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
anyone, which, let's be honest, is a

736
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,870
anyone, which, let's be honest, is a mildly unfair advantage in the love

737
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
mildly unfair advantage in the love

738
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,350
mildly unfair advantage in the love department. Despite being the embodiment

739
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
department. Despite being the embodiment

740
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,030
department. Despite being the embodiment of desire, Aphrodite's own love life was

741
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
of desire, Aphrodite's own love life was

742
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,269
of desire, Aphrodite's own love life was complicated. She was married to

743
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
complicated. She was married to

744
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,069
complicated. She was married to Heristas, the hardworking god of fire

745
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
Heristas, the hardworking god of fire

746
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,750
Heristas, the hardworking god of fire and blacksmithing.

747
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:47,760
and blacksmithing.

748
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,430
and blacksmithing. But she famously preferred the company

749
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
But she famously preferred the company

750
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,110
But she famously preferred the company of Arri, the god of war, which tells you

751
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
of Arri, the god of war, which tells you

752
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,629
of Arri, the god of war, which tells you everything you need to know about her

753
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
everything you need to know about her

754
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,430
everything you need to know about her taste in men. Their affair was exposed

755
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
taste in men. Their affair was exposed

756
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,509
taste in men. Their affair was exposed when Heristas trapped them mid romance

757
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
when Heristas trapped them mid romance

758
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,670
when Heristas trapped them mid romance in a golden net and summoned the other

759
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
in a golden net and summoned the other

760
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,629
in a golden net and summoned the other gods to come take a look. Ancient

761
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
gods to come take a look. Ancient

762
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,550
gods to come take a look. Ancient Greece, where revenge and group

763
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
Greece, where revenge and group

764
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,389
Greece, where revenge and group humiliation were considered excellent

765
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
humiliation were considered excellent

766
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,550
humiliation were considered excellent conflict resolution.

767
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
conflict resolution.

768
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,629
conflict resolution. But Aphroditi wasn't all chaos and

769
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
But Aphroditi wasn't all chaos and

770
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,230
But Aphroditi wasn't all chaos and cheating. She had a softer side, too.

771
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
cheating. She had a softer side, too.

772
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,550
cheating. She had a softer side, too. She helped young lovers, presided over

773
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
She helped young lovers, presided over

774
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,470
She helped young lovers, presided over weddings, and brought beauty to the

775
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
weddings, and brought beauty to the

776
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,189
weddings, and brought beauty to the world. She was the goddess people prayed

777
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
world. She was the goddess people prayed

778
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,829
world. She was the goddess people prayed to before confessing a crush or trying

779
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
to before confessing a crush or trying

780
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,430
to before confessing a crush or trying to charm their way out of something

781
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
to charm their way out of something

782
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,949
to charm their way out of something stupid. Still, she wasn't above starting

783
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
stupid. Still, she wasn't above starting

784
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,509
stupid. Still, she wasn't above starting wars. She's the one who offered Helen of

785
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
wars. She's the one who offered Helen of

786
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,189
wars. She's the one who offered Helen of Troy to Paris, sparking the Trojan War.

787
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
Troy to Paris, sparking the Trojan War.

788
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,670
Troy to Paris, sparking the Trojan War. Why? Because she wanted to win a divine

789
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
Why? Because she wanted to win a divine

790
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,590
Why? Because she wanted to win a divine beauty contest.

791
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
beauty contest.

792
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,790
beauty contest. Yes, really. An entire civilization

793
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
Yes, really. An entire civilization

794
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,269
Yes, really. An entire civilization burned because Aphroditi wanted a golden

795
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
burned because Aphroditi wanted a golden

796
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,389
burned because Aphroditi wanted a golden apple that said to the fairest. She's

797
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
apple that said to the fairest. She's

798
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,030
apple that said to the fairest. She's the patron goddess of desire, not

799
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
the patron goddess of desire, not

800
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,550
the patron goddess of desire, not stability.

801
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
stability.

802
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,670
stability. Beautiful, intoxicating, and absolutely

803
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
Beautiful, intoxicating, and absolutely

804
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,350
Beautiful, intoxicating, and absolutely not interested in your relationship

805
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
not interested in your relationship

806
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,069
not interested in your relationship boundaries. Heristas was the god of

00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
boundaries. Heristas was the god of

808
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,270
boundaries. Heristas was the god of fire, metalwork, craftsmanship, and

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
fire, metalwork, craftsmanship, and

810

fire, metalwork, craftsmanship, and being the only Olympian who actually had

being the only Olympian who actually had

812
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,829
being the only Olympian who actually had a job. While the rest of the gods were

813
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
a job. While the rest of the gods were

814
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,789
a job. While the rest of the gods were busy starting wars, chasing mortals, or

815
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
busy starting wars, chasing mortals, or

816
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,510
busy starting wars, chasing mortals, or throwing lightning like confetti, Histus

817

throwing lightning like confetti, Histus

818
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,150
throwing lightning like confetti, Histus was in the workshop, forging weapons,

none of it is flattering.

826
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,110
none of it is flattering. In one version, he's born deformed, and

In one version, he's born deformed, and

In one version, he's born deformed, and Ha, repulsed by his appearance, tosses

In another, Zeus does the tossing after

In another, Zeus does the tossing after a family argument. Either way, the man

a family argument. Either way, the man

838

Hermes also had a signature accessory, the kaducius, a winged staff with two

the kaducius, a winged staff with two

1016
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,510
the kaducius, a winged staff with two intertwined snakes. It's often confused

1017
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
intertwined snakes. It's often confused

1018
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,350
intertwined snakes. It's often confused with the symbol of medicine, which is

1019
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
with the symbol of medicine, which is

1020
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,830
with the symbol of medicine, which is ironic considering Hermes's primary

1021
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
ironic considering Hermes's primary

1022
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,710
ironic considering Hermes's primary qualifications were speed, lying, and

1023
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
qualifications were speed, lying, and

1024
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,029
qualifications were speed, lying, and professional boundary hopping. If

1025
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
professional boundary hopping. If

1026
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,590
professional boundary hopping. If Olympus had an IT department, Hermes

1027
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
Olympus had an IT department, Hermes

1028
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,430
Olympus had an IT department, Hermes would be the overcaffeinated tech guy

1029
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
would be the overcaffeinated tech guy

1030
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,590
would be the overcaffeinated tech guy who speaks in acronyms, solves your

1031
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
who speaks in acronyms, solves your

1032
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,350
who speaks in acronyms, solves your problems in 2 minutes, and then

1033
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
problems in 2 minutes, and then

1034
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,669
problems in 2 minutes, and then disappears to go optimize cloud

1035
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
disappears to go optimize cloud

1036
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,070
disappears to go optimize cloud functions, which may or may not involve

1037
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
functions, which may or may not involve

1038
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,029
functions, which may or may not involve stealing Zeus's wallet. He's clever,

1039
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
stealing Zeus's wallet. He's clever,

1040
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,470
stealing Zeus's wallet. He's clever, quick, unreliable, and deeply lovable.

1041
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
quick, unreliable, and deeply lovable.

1042
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,789
quick, unreliable, and deeply lovable. The god of getting things done, getting

away with it, and not answering

1046
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,029
away with it, and not answering follow-up questions. Deita is the

00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
follow-up questions. Deita is the

1048
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,350

fruit, and the world blooms with

1058
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,789
fruit, and the world blooms with abundance. When she's upset, well, say

00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
abundance. When she's upset, well, say

1060

one's getting any sacrifices.

1114

of the most important natural cycles in

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,630
of the most important natural cycles in human existence comes from Deita's

human existence comes from Deita's

1128
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,070
human existence comes from Deita's seasonal mood swings. Global agriculture

1129
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,080
seasonal mood swings. Global agriculture

1130
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,310
seasonal mood swings. Global agriculture powered by maternal grief and emotional

1131

powered by maternal grief and emotional

1132
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,669
powered by maternal grief and emotional blackmail. Mythology at its finest.

1133

blackmail. Mythology at its finest.

1134
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,430
blackmail. Mythology at its finest. Deita also had a strong sense of

Deita also had a strong sense of

1136
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,909
Deita also had a strong sense of justice. She once taught humans how to

1137
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:03,919
justice. She once taught humans how to

1138
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,549
justice. She once taught humans how to grow wheat and build civilizations,

1139
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
grow wheat and build civilizations,

1140
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,549
grow wheat and build civilizations, then turned around and burned a royal

baby because the parents interrupted her

1144
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,909
baby because the parents interrupted her mid ritual. It's a fine line between

1145
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:13,919
mid ritual. It's a fine line between

1146
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,750
mid ritual. It's a fine line between goddess of life and terrifying earth

1147

goddess of life and terrifying earth

1148
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,029

nurture, resilience, and the sacred bond

1152
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,390
nurture, resilience, and the sacred bond between mother and child. She brings

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
between mother and child. She brings

1154
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,230
between mother and child. She brings life from the ground and takes it away

1155
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
life from the ground and takes it away

1156
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,269
life from the ground and takes it away just as easily. Dianisis is the god of

decisions you make after your third glass of whatever he's pouring. He's the

00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
glass of whatever he's pouring. He's the

1166
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,630
glass of whatever he's pouring. He's the divine embodiment of yolo, wrapped in

Olympian gods treated mortals like chess

1347
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,750

fatal. As a moon goddess, she

1359
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,870

Artemis was the moon's cold, focused

1371
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,789

Mount Olympus. If the gods had linked

every day in a flaming chariot. No

1417
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,710
every day in a flaming chariot. No pressure if you're running late. But

1418
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
pressure if you're running late. But

1419
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,110

Apollo is dramatic. He's emotional. He's

1427

Apollo mourned her loss. Then turned her

1439
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,830
Apollo mourned her loss. Then turned her into a sacred symbol and wore her leaves

1440
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
into a sacred symbol and wore her leaves

1441
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,029

1443
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,190

userfriendly.

1461
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,909
userfriendly. Apollo had a complicated relationship

00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:55,919
Apollo had a complicated relationship

1463
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,870
Apollo had a complicated relationship with love. He chased several mortals,

1464
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
with love. He chased several mortals,

1465
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,350

varying degrees of poetic overkill. When a Spartan prince named Hyasinus died

1470
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:06,559
a Spartan prince named Hyasinus died

1471
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,630
a Spartan prince named Hyasinus died during a discus game, possibly from

1472
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,640
during a discus game, possibly from

1473
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,029
during a discus game, possibly from Apollo's own poorly thrown disc, he was

1474
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
Apollo's own poorly thrown disc, he was

1475
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,950
Apollo's own poorly thrown disc, he was so distraught he turned the boy into a

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
so distraught he turned the boy into a

1477
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,669
so distraught he turned the boy into a flower, which is sweet if you ignore the

1478
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:15,679
flower, which is sweet if you ignore the

1479
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,549
flower, which is sweet if you ignore the blunt force trauma part. Despite all

1480
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:18,559
blunt force trauma part. Despite all

1481
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,830
blunt force trauma part. Despite all this, Apollo was also a healer. His son,

1482
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,840
this, Apollo was also a healer. His son,

1483
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,310
this, Apollo was also a healer. His son, Eskelepius, became the god of medicine,

1484
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
Eskelepius, became the god of medicine,

1485
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,110
Eskelepius, became the god of medicine, and Apollo himself could cure plagues or

1486
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
and Apollo himself could cure plagues or

1487
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,510
and Apollo himself could cure plagues or cause them, depending on how offended he

1488
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:29,520
cause them, depending on how offended he

1489
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,950
cause them, depending on how offended he felt that day. In short, Apollo was

1490
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:32,960
felt that day. In short, Apollo was

1491
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,590
felt that day. In short, Apollo was brilliance wrapped in insecurity, power

1492
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:35,600
brilliance wrapped in insecurity, power

1493
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,750
brilliance wrapped in insecurity, power dressed in poetry, and charm with a

1495
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,470
dressed in poetry, and charm with a short fuse. The kind of god who'd write

1496
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
short fuse. The kind of god who'd write

1497
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,310
short fuse. The kind of god who'd write you a love song and then shoot you with

1498
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
you a love song and then shoot you with

1499
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,269
you a love song and then shoot you with an arrow if you didn't clap. Hestia is

1500
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
an arrow if you didn't clap. Hestia is

1501
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,509
an arrow if you didn't clap. Hestia is the goddess of the hearth, home, and

1502
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
the goddess of the hearth, home, and

1503
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,149
the goddess of the hearth, home, and domestic peace, which is ancient Greek

00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:50,159
domestic peace, which is ancient Greek

1505
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,630
domestic peace, which is ancient Greek for the only Olympian who didn't cause

1506
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640

Because of her, every meal began and

1587
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,950
Because of her, every meal began and ended with an offering. Every city had

every prayer circle probably had someone

1593
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,149
every prayer circle probably had someone whispering, "Thank you for not being a

00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
argued about whose temple caught fire.

1611

the one who doesn't demand attention,

anything while starving. A compromise

1671
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,910
anything while starving. A compromise was reached. Pesphanie could return if

1672
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,920
was reached. Pesphanie could return if

1673
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,349
was reached. Pesphanie could return if she hadn't eaten anything in the

1674
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:35,359
she hadn't eaten anything in the

1675
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,950
she hadn't eaten anything in the underworld, which of course she had. six

1676
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960
underworld, which of course she had. six

1677
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,589
underworld, which of course she had. six pomegranate seeds, just enough to

1678
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:41,599
pomegranate seeds, just enough to

1679
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,589
pomegranate seeds, just enough to legally bind her to a part-time gig in

1680
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:43,599
legally bind her to a part-time gig in

1681
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,150
legally bind her to a part-time gig in the land of the dead. Thus began her

1682
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,160
the land of the dead. Thus began her

1683
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,390
the land of the dead. Thus began her dual role. Half the year on Earth with

1684
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:48,400
dual role. Half the year on Earth with

1685
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,109
dual role. Half the year on Earth with Deita, ushering in spring and summer,

1686
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
Deita, ushering in spring and summer,

1687
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,630
Deita, ushering in spring and summer, the other half with Hades in the

1688
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,640
the other half with Hades in the

1689
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,670
the other half with Hades in the underworld, giving us fall and winter.

1690
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680
underworld, giving us fall and winter.

1691
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,750
underworld, giving us fall and winter. The ancient Greeks invented seasonal

1692
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:57,760
The ancient Greeks invented seasonal

1693
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,829
The ancient Greeks invented seasonal depression with a myth. But here's where

1694
00:35:59,829 --> 00:35:59,839
depression with a myth. But here's where

1695
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,310
depression with a myth. But here's where things get interesting. Over time,

1696
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,320
things get interesting. Over time,

1697
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,310
things get interesting. Over time, Pesphanany embraced her role as queen of

1698
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
Pesphanany embraced her role as queen of

1699
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,550
Pesphanany embraced her role as queen of the dead. She wasn't just a sad

1700
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:06,560
the dead. She wasn't just a sad

1701
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,710
the dead. She wasn't just a sad kidnapped flower girl. She became a

1702
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:08,720
kidnapped flower girl. She became a

1703
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,470
kidnapped flower girl. She became a ruler, calm, firm, and quietly powerful.

1704
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:12,480
ruler, calm, firm, and quietly powerful.

1705
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,630
ruler, calm, firm, and quietly powerful. Mortals prayed to her for mercy, for

1706
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
Mortals prayed to her for mercy, for

1707
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,790
Mortals prayed to her for mercy, for safe passage, for understanding the

1708
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:16,800
safe passage, for understanding the

1709
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,589
safe passage, for understanding the balance between life and death. She

1710
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
balance between life and death. She

1711
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,990
balance between life and death. She represents transformation, not just

1712
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,000
represents transformation, not just

1713
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,790
represents transformation, not just seasonal, but emotional.

1714
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800
seasonal, but emotional.

1715
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,109
seasonal, but emotional. The shift from innocence to strength,

1716
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:27,119
The shift from innocence to strength,

1717
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,390
The shift from innocence to strength, from being taken to taking control.

1718
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
from being taken to taking control.

1719
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,950
from being taken to taking control. Pesphanany is the goddess of duality.

1720
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:32,960
Pesphanany is the goddess of duality.

1721
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,109
Pesphanany is the goddess of duality. She walks through flowers and bones with

1722
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,119
She walks through flowers and bones with

1723
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,910
She walks through flowers and bones with equal grace. She's the reason flowers

1724
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
equal grace. She's the reason flowers

1725
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,270
equal grace. She's the reason flowers bloom and the reason they wilt. Before

1726
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280
bloom and the reason they wilt. Before

1727
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,430
bloom and the reason they wilt. Before Psyche was even old enough to understand

1728
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
Psyche was even old enough to understand

1729
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,910
Psyche was even old enough to understand the word goddess, she was being compared

1730
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:45,920
the word goddess, she was being compared

1731
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,470
the word goddess, she was being compared to one. By the time she reached

1732
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,480
to one. By the time she reached

1733
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,870
to one. By the time she reached womanhood, statues of Aphroditi were

1734
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
womanhood, statues of Aphroditi were

1735
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,109
womanhood, statues of Aphroditi were gathering dust while mortals traveled

1736
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:53,119
gathering dust while mortals traveled

1737
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,430
gathering dust while mortals traveled miles just to glimpse the face of this

1738
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440
miles just to glimpse the face of this

1739
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,470
miles just to glimpse the face of this mortal girl. Her beauty wasn't simply

1740
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
mortal girl. Her beauty wasn't simply

1741
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,310
mortal girl. Her beauty wasn't simply admired. It was worshiped. Entire crowds

1742
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:02,320
admired. It was worshiped. Entire crowds

1743
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,470
admired. It was worshiped. Entire crowds treated her as if she were Aphroditi,

1744
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:04,480
treated her as if she were Aphroditi,

1745
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,510
treated her as if she were Aphroditi, reincarnated in flesh and bone. People

1746
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
reincarnated in flesh and bone. People

1747
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,510
reincarnated in flesh and bone. People whispered that she must be divine, that

1748
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,520
whispered that she must be divine, that

1749
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,589
whispered that she must be divine, that no mortal woman could look like this by

1750
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
no mortal woman could look like this by

1751
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,630
no mortal woman could look like this by accident. But for Psyche, all the

1752
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
accident. But for Psyche, all the

1753
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,349
accident. But for Psyche, all the reverence felt hollow. She walked

1754
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:17,359
reverence felt hollow. She walked

1755
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,030
reverence felt hollow. She walked through cities and villages like a

1756
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,040
through cities and villages like a

1757
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,750
through cities and villages like a phantom, adored but untouched,

1758
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:21,760
phantom, adored but untouched,

1759
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,550
phantom, adored but untouched, celebrated but alone. No one dared to

1760
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560
celebrated but alone. No one dared to

1761
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,190
celebrated but alone. No one dared to approach her with true affection. Men

1762
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,200
approach her with true affection. Men

1763
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,349
approach her with true affection. Men looked at her like a living painting,

1764
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:29,359
looked at her like a living painting,

1765
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,710
looked at her like a living painting, flawless, silent, untouchable.

1766
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:32,720
flawless, silent, untouchable.

1767
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,589
flawless, silent, untouchable. Even her family, though proud, grew

1768
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:35,599
Even her family, though proud, grew

1769
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,390
Even her family, though proud, grew uneasy. Her two sisters had married

1770
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:38,400
uneasy. Her two sisters had married

1771
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,670
uneasy. Her two sisters had married noble men, begun families, and lived the

1772
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
noble men, begun families, and lived the

1773
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,910
noble men, begun families, and lived the kind of grounded, warm lives that Psyche

1774
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
kind of grounded, warm lives that Psyche

1775
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,109
kind of grounded, warm lives that Psyche herself craved. But no suitor would dare

1776
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:47,119
herself craved. But no suitor would dare

1777
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,030
herself craved. But no suitor would dare to court a girl believed to be a rival

1778
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,040
to court a girl believed to be a rival

1779
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,589
to court a girl believed to be a rival of Aphrodite. And therein lay the

1780
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
of Aphrodite. And therein lay the

1781
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,870
of Aphrodite. And therein lay the danger. You see, the gods weren't fond

1782
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:54,880
danger. You see, the gods weren't fond

1783
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,150
danger. You see, the gods weren't fond of competition, especially Aphroditi.

1784
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,160
of competition, especially Aphroditi.

1785
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,230
of competition, especially Aphroditi. Watching her temples grow silent while

1786
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,240
Watching her temples grow silent while

1787
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,470
Watching her temples grow silent while mortals laid garlands at the feet of a

1788
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:02,480
mortals laid garlands at the feet of a

1789
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,790
mortals laid garlands at the feet of a mere girl made the goddess burn with

1790
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
mere girl made the goddess burn with

1791
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,390
mere girl made the goddess burn with divine rage. To her, Psyche wasn't a

1792
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,400
divine rage. To her, Psyche wasn't a

1793
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,790
divine rage. To her, Psyche wasn't a beautiful child. She was an insult

1794
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:10,800
beautiful child. She was an insult

1795
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,670
beautiful child. She was an insult carved into flesh. Yet Psyche knew none

1796
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:13,680
carved into flesh. Yet Psyche knew none

1797
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,310
carved into flesh. Yet Psyche knew none of this. She spent her days walking

1798
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:16,320
of this. She spent her days walking

1799
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,069
of this. She spent her days walking gardens alone, speaking to no one.

1800
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:20,079
gardens alone, speaking to no one.

1801
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,829
gardens alone, speaking to no one. She'd never felt a lover's touch or

1802
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:21,839
She'd never felt a lover's touch or

1803
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,630
She'd never felt a lover's touch or heard a whispered vow in the dark. Her

1804
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:24,640
heard a whispered vow in the dark. Her

1805
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,109
heard a whispered vow in the dark. Her beauty had become a curse, one that

1806
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:27,119
beauty had become a curse, one that

1807
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,870
beauty had become a curse, one that distanced her from the only thing she

1808
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:28,880
distanced her from the only thing she

1809
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,550
distanced her from the only thing she truly wanted, a soul that saw her, not

1810
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:32,560
truly wanted, a soul that saw her, not

1811
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,790
truly wanted, a soul that saw her, not just her face.

1812
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:34,800
just her face.

1813
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,030
just her face. She would stand by her window at dusk,

1814
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,040
She would stand by her window at dusk,

1815
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,030
She would stand by her window at dusk, watching the horizon fade and thinking

1816
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,040
watching the horizon fade and thinking

1817
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,349
watching the horizon fade and thinking perhaps this was her fate, to be loved

1818
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:41,359
perhaps this was her fate, to be loved

1819
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,109
perhaps this was her fate, to be loved by all, but held by none. No priest, no

1820
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:45,119
by all, but held by none. No priest, no

1821
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,109
by all, but held by none. No priest, no oracle, no stranger ever offered an

1822
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
oracle, no stranger ever offered an

1823
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,550
oracle, no stranger ever offered an answer until one day someone did. But it

1824
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:50,560
answer until one day someone did. But it

1825
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,349
answer until one day someone did. But it wasn't a man. It wasn't a priest. And it

1826
00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:53,359
wasn't a man. It wasn't a priest. And it

1827
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,550
wasn't a man. It wasn't a priest. And it wasn't a mortal. It was a goddess. And

1828
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,560
wasn't a mortal. It was a goddess. And

1829
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,630
wasn't a mortal. It was a goddess. And she wasn't offering love. She was

1830
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:58,640
she wasn't offering love. She was

1831
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,670
she wasn't offering love. She was demanding revenge. On Mount Olympus,

1832
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:01,680
demanding revenge. On Mount Olympus,

1833
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,150
demanding revenge. On Mount Olympus, beauty was more than vanity. It was

1834
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,160
beauty was more than vanity. It was

1835
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,550
beauty was more than vanity. It was power. And no one wielded it like

1836
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:06,560
power. And no one wielded it like

1837
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,790
power. And no one wielded it like Aphroditi. She was the goddess of

1838
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:08,800
Aphroditi. She was the goddess of

1839
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,030
Aphroditi. She was the goddess of desire, of seduction, of divine charm.

1840
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,040
desire, of seduction, of divine charm.

1841
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,349
desire, of seduction, of divine charm. But lately, her temples echoed with

1842
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
But lately, her temples echoed with

1843
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,990
But lately, her temples echoed with emptiness. Her statue stood lonely

1844
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,000
emptiness. Her statue stood lonely

1845
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,750
emptiness. Her statue stood lonely beneath the sun. Why? Because mortals

1846
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,760
beneath the sun. Why? Because mortals

1847
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,950
beneath the sun. Why? Because mortals now knelt before a human girl, Psyche,

1848
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:24,960
now knelt before a human girl, Psyche,

1849
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,750
now knelt before a human girl, Psyche, as if she were the new goddess of love.

1850
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
as if she were the new goddess of love.

1851
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,589
as if she were the new goddess of love. To Aphrodite, this wasn't just

1852
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:29,599
To Aphrodite, this wasn't just

1853
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,550
To Aphrodite, this wasn't just offensive. It was treason.

1854
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:32,560
offensive. It was treason.

1855
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,390
offensive. It was treason. The goddess watched from her celestial

1856
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,400
The goddess watched from her celestial

1857
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,670
The goddess watched from her celestial perch, her envy twisting into hatred.

1858
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:37,680
perch, her envy twisting into hatred.

1859
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,470
perch, her envy twisting into hatred. She had destroyed kings for less. How

1860
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,480
She had destroyed kings for less. How

1861
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,230
She had destroyed kings for less. How dare a mortal girl steal her

1862
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
dare a mortal girl steal her

1863
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,870
dare a mortal girl steal her worshippers? How dare she exist as a

1864
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:44,880
worshippers? How dare she exist as a

1865
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,990
worshippers? How dare she exist as a living insult to divine beauty? And so

1866
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,000
living insult to divine beauty? And so

1867
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,710
living insult to divine beauty? And so Aphrodite did what goddesses do. She

1868
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:50,720
Aphrodite did what goddesses do. She

1869
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,790
Aphrodite did what goddesses do. She summoned her son, Aeros. Now Aeros

1870
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:54,800
summoned her son, Aeros. Now Aeros

1871
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,589
summoned her son, Aeros. Now Aeros wasn't just any deity. He was the god of

1872
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
wasn't just any deity. He was the god of

1873
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,390
wasn't just any deity. He was the god of love, yes, but not the soft, tender love

1874
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,400
love, yes, but not the soft, tender love

1875
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,829
love, yes, but not the soft, tender love mortals wrote poems about. No, Aeros

1876
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
mortals wrote poems about. No, Aeros

1877
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,470
mortals wrote poems about. No, Aeros dealt in chaos. He sparked passion where

1878
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,480
dealt in chaos. He sparked passion where

1879
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,109
dealt in chaos. He sparked passion where there should be none. He made kings fall

1880
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
there should be none. He made kings fall

1881
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,670
there should be none. He made kings fall for swindlers, queens for slaves,

1882
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:11,680
for swindlers, queens for slaves,

1883
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,470
for swindlers, queens for slaves, enemies for each other. His arrows

1884
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
enemies for each other. His arrows

1885
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,390
enemies for each other. His arrows didn't ask for permission. They

1886
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,400
didn't ask for permission. They

1887
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,109
didn't ask for permission. They shattered logic, loyalty, and sometimes

1888
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
shattered logic, loyalty, and sometimes

1889
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,510
shattered logic, loyalty, and sometimes entire empires.

1890
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:21,520
entire empires.

1891
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,710
entire empires. Aphrodites command was simple. Make

1892
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:24,720
Aphrodites command was simple. Make

1893
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,710
Aphrodites command was simple. Make Psyche fall in love with the most

1894
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:26,720
Psyche fall in love with the most

1895
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,750
Psyche fall in love with the most hideous, vile creature on Earth.

1896
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:29,760
hideous, vile creature on Earth.

1897
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,069
hideous, vile creature on Earth. Something monstrous. Something beneath

1898
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:32,079
Something monstrous. Something beneath

1899
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,990
Something monstrous. Something beneath even the worms.

1900
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000
even the worms.

1901
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,910
even the worms. Let her feel what it's like to be mocked

1902
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:35,920
Let her feel what it's like to be mocked

1903
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,589
Let her feel what it's like to be mocked by love.

1904
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:37,599
by love.

1905
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,589
by love. Aeros, ever the obedient son, accepted.

1906
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
Aeros, ever the obedient son, accepted.

1907
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,150
Aeros, ever the obedient son, accepted. Bao slung over his back, quiver full of

1908
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,160
Bao slung over his back, quiver full of

1909
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,150
Bao slung over his back, quiver full of divine arrows. He descended to the

1910
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,160
divine arrows. He descended to the

1911
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,589
divine arrows. He descended to the mortal realm under the cover of

1912
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:47,599
mortal realm under the cover of

1913
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,790
mortal realm under the cover of moonlight. He found Psyche asleep in her

1914
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:50,800
moonlight. He found Psyche asleep in her

1915
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,030
moonlight. He found Psyche asleep in her chamber, candle light flickering across

1916
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,040
chamber, candle light flickering across

1917
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,589
chamber, candle light flickering across her features like water. She was

1918
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:55,599
her features like water. She was

1919
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,990
her features like water. She was beautiful, too beautiful. And Aeros, who

1920
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,000
beautiful, too beautiful. And Aeros, who

1921
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,390
beautiful, too beautiful. And Aeros, who had pierced a thousand hearts, felt his

1922
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:02,400
had pierced a thousand hearts, felt his

1923
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,910
had pierced a thousand hearts, felt his own skip a beat. This wasn't right. This

1924
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:05,920
own skip a beat. This wasn't right. This

1925
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,870
own skip a beat. This wasn't right. This wasn't part of the plan. Still, he

1926
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:08,880
wasn't part of the plan. Still, he

1927
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,870
wasn't part of the plan. Still, he reached for his arrow. But in his

1928
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
reached for his arrow. But in his

1929
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,430
reached for his arrow. But in his distraction, something went wrong. His

1930
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:13,440
distraction, something went wrong. His

1931
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,670
distraction, something went wrong. His hand slipped. The arrow pricricked his

1932
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
hand slipped. The arrow pricricked his

1933
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,030
hand slipped. The arrow pricricked his skin. Just a drop. But it was enough.

1934
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,040
skin. Just a drop. But it was enough.

1935
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,109
skin. Just a drop. But it was enough. The god of love had just fallen victim

1936
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:21,119
The god of love had just fallen victim

1937
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,990
The god of love had just fallen victim to his own power. And in that moment,

1938
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
to his own power. And in that moment,

1939
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,030
to his own power. And in that moment, fate shifted. For Aeros would no longer

1940
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
fate shifted. For Aeros would no longer

1941
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,109
fate shifted. For Aeros would no longer be his mother's weapon. He would be

1942
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:29,119
be his mother's weapon. He would be

1943
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,230
be his mother's weapon. He would be Psyche's silent protector. But neither

1944
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
Psyche's silent protector. But neither

1945
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,990
Psyche's silent protector. But neither of them knew what price the gods would

1946
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,000
of them knew what price the gods would

1947
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,870
of them knew what price the gods would demand for this forbidden affection. And

1948
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
demand for this forbidden affection. And

1949
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,870
demand for this forbidden affection. And Aphroditi would not forgive betrayal.

1950
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:40,880
Aphroditi would not forgive betrayal.

1951
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,950
Aphroditi would not forgive betrayal. Os vanished before psyche could stir

1952
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:42,960
Os vanished before psyche could stir

1953
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,430
Os vanished before psyche could stir from her sleep. The wound from his own

1954
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,440
from her sleep. The wound from his own

1955
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,390
from her sleep. The wound from his own arrow still warm on his skin. He had

1956
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
arrow still warm on his skin. He had

1957
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,630
arrow still warm on his skin. He had pierced countless hearts, but never once

1958
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
pierced countless hearts, but never once

1959
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,990
pierced countless hearts, but never once had he fallen prey to his own game. Now,

1960
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
had he fallen prey to his own game. Now,

1961
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,230
had he fallen prey to his own game. Now, with every beat of his heart, he felt a

1962
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,240
with every beat of his heart, he felt a

1963
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,710
with every beat of his heart, he felt a longing he didn't understand, a need to

1964
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:58,720
longing he didn't understand, a need to

1965
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,589
longing he didn't understand, a need to protect her, to cherish her, to hide her

1966
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:01,599
protect her, to cherish her, to hide her

1967
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,230
protect her, to cherish her, to hide her from the cruel eyes of Olympus.

1968
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,240
from the cruel eyes of Olympus.

1969
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,030
from the cruel eyes of Olympus. But protection came with sacrifice. He

1970
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,040
But protection came with sacrifice. He

1971
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,190
But protection came with sacrifice. He couldn't tell her the truth. If

1972
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200
couldn't tell her the truth. If

1973
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,109
couldn't tell her the truth. If Aphrodite discovered he had disobeyed

1974
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
Aphrodite discovered he had disobeyed

1975
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,069
Aphrodite discovered he had disobeyed her, worse, that he had fallen in love,

1976
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079
her, worse, that he had fallen in love,

1977
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,190
her, worse, that he had fallen in love, there would be no mercy. Not for him,

1978
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,200
there would be no mercy. Not for him,

1979
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,190
there would be no mercy. Not for him, not for Psyche.

1980
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
not for Psyche.

1981
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,470
not for Psyche. So, Aeros made a quiet vow. He would

1982
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,480
So, Aeros made a quiet vow. He would

1983
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,190
So, Aeros made a quiet vow. He would love her from the shadows. Meanwhile,

1984
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,200
love her from the shadows. Meanwhile,

1985
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,150
love her from the shadows. Meanwhile, Psyche's life grew stranger by the day.

1986
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160
Psyche's life grew stranger by the day.

1987
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,030
Psyche's life grew stranger by the day. No suitors came. Her beauty, once a

1988
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,040
No suitors came. Her beauty, once a

1989
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,230
No suitors came. Her beauty, once a spectacle, now seemed cursed. Whispers

1990
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,240
spectacle, now seemed cursed. Whispers

1991
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,309
spectacle, now seemed cursed. Whispers of divine punishment swirled through the

1992
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:36,319
of divine punishment swirled through the

1993
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,109
of divine punishment swirled through the kingdom. Her father, desperate and

1994
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
kingdom. Her father, desperate and

1995
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,230
kingdom. Her father, desperate and afraid, consulted the oracle of Apollo,

1996
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:42,240
afraid, consulted the oracle of Apollo,

1997
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,190
afraid, consulted the oracle of Apollo, and the words returned were cruel. She

1998
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,200
and the words returned were cruel. She

1999
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,230
and the words returned were cruel. She shall not wed a mortal man. Instead, she

2000
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,240
shall not wed a mortal man. Instead, she

2001
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,870
shall not wed a mortal man. Instead, she will marry a monster, a beast feared

2002
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
will marry a monster, a beast feared

2003
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,270
will marry a monster, a beast feared even by the gods. Send her to the

2004
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
even by the gods. Send her to the

2005
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,390
even by the gods. Send her to the mountaintop, dressed as a bride. There,

2006
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:56,400
mountaintop, dressed as a bride. There,

2007
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,670
mountaintop, dressed as a bride. There, her fate awaits. Her family wept. Her

2008
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
her fate awaits. Her family wept. Her

2009
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,790
her fate awaits. Her family wept. Her sisters gasped, but Psyche stood still,

2010
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:02,800
sisters gasped, but Psyche stood still,

2011
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,950
sisters gasped, but Psyche stood still, silent, as if the wind had carved her

2012
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:04,960
silent, as if the wind had carved her

2013
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,990
silent, as if the wind had carved her into stone. A monster. This was her

2014
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,000
into stone. A monster. This was her

2015
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,349
into stone. A monster. This was her destiny. Not love, not choice, but

2016
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:11,359
destiny. Not love, not choice, but

2017
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,870
destiny. Not love, not choice, but sacrifice. Still she agreed, not out of

2018
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:14,880
sacrifice. Still she agreed, not out of

2019
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,750
sacrifice. Still she agreed, not out of courage, but out of resignation. She had

2020
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:17,760
courage, but out of resignation. She had

2021
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,829
courage, but out of resignation. She had been adored like a goddess, yet never

2022
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:19,839
been adored like a goddess, yet never

2023
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,349
been adored like a goddess, yet never touched by love. Perhaps this, this

2024
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:23,359
touched by love. Perhaps this, this

2025
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,069
touched by love. Perhaps this, this cruel, monstrous fate was simply

2026
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:26,079
cruel, monstrous fate was simply

2027
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,910
cruel, monstrous fate was simply balance.

2028
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920
balance.

2029
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,390
balance. Aos watched from above, his heart

2030
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,400
Aos watched from above, his heart

2031
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,870
Aos watched from above, his heart twisting with guilt. He had meant to

2032
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
twisting with guilt. He had meant to

2033
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,950
twisting with guilt. He had meant to protect her, but now the gods had spun a

2034
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:34,960
protect her, but now the gods had spun a

2035
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,109
protect her, but now the gods had spun a web he couldn't untangle. If he

2036
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
web he couldn't untangle. If he

2037
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,710
web he couldn't untangle. If he intervened openly, his mother would

2038
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:38,720
intervened openly, his mother would

2039
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,230
intervened openly, his mother would know. But if he did nothing, Psyche

2040
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:42,240
know. But if he did nothing, Psyche

2041
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,910
know. But if he did nothing, Psyche would be lost. So he devised a plan. He

2042
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:45,920
would be lost. So he devised a plan. He

2043
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,910
would be lost. So he devised a plan. He would take her to a secret place, a

2044
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:47,920
would take her to a secret place, a

2045
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,230
would take her to a secret place, a hidden palace known only to him, cloaked

2046
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
hidden palace known only to him, cloaked

2047
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,870
hidden palace known only to him, cloaked in illusion and silence. He would love

2048
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:52,880
in illusion and silence. He would love

2049
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,550
in illusion and silence. He would love her, not as a god, but as a shadow. He

2050
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:56,560
her, not as a god, but as a shadow. He

2051
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,190
her, not as a god, but as a shadow. He would never show his face, never speak

2052
00:43:59,190 --> 00:43:59,200
would never show his face, never speak

2053
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,470
would never show his face, never speak his name, and above all, he would never

2054
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
his name, and above all, he would never

2055
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,030
his name, and above all, he would never tell her the truth. Because if she knew

2056
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:05,040
tell her the truth. Because if she knew

2057
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,230
tell her the truth. Because if she knew who he was, who she was truly with,

2058
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,240
who he was, who she was truly with,

2059
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,870
who he was, who she was truly with, everything would shatter. Even the god

2060
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
everything would shatter. Even the god

2061
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,349
everything would shatter. Even the god of love was afraid of heartbreak. The

2062
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:13,359
of love was afraid of heartbreak. The

2063
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,510
of love was afraid of heartbreak. The wind was soft but strong as it carried

2064
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:15,520
wind was soft but strong as it carried

2065
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,550
wind was soft but strong as it carried Psyche away from the mountain peak. She

2066
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,560
Psyche away from the mountain peak. She

2067
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,550
Psyche away from the mountain peak. She had expected cold rock and nashing

2068
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
had expected cold rock and nashing

2069
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,030
had expected cold rock and nashing teeth. She had braced for a monster's

2070
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
teeth. She had braced for a monster's

2071
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,030
teeth. She had braced for a monster's roar, but instead silence,

2072
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,040
roar, but instead silence,

2073
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,150
roar, but instead silence, gentle, surreal silence.

2074
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,160
gentle, surreal silence.

2075
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,230
gentle, surreal silence. When she opened her eyes, she was no

2076
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
When she opened her eyes, she was no

2077
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,710
When she opened her eyes, she was no longer on the mountain. She stood in a

2078
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
longer on the mountain. She stood in a

2079
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,349
longer on the mountain. She stood in a meadow of glowing flowers, more radiant

2080
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:37,359
meadow of glowing flowers, more radiant

2081
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,990
meadow of glowing flowers, more radiant than any garden she had ever known. A

2082
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,000
than any garden she had ever known. A

2083
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,390
than any garden she had ever known. A path of polished stone wound through the

2084
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:42,400
path of polished stone wound through the

2085
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,950
path of polished stone wound through the field, leading to something impossible,

2086
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960
field, leading to something impossible,

2087
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,910
field, leading to something impossible, a palace, grander than anything human

2088
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
a palace, grander than anything human

2089
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,390
a palace, grander than anything human hands could build. Its pillars

2090
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:50,400
hands could build. Its pillars

2091
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,950
hands could build. Its pillars shimmerred like moonlight on water. Its

2092
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:52,960
shimmerred like moonlight on water. Its

2093
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,589
shimmerred like moonlight on water. Its halls whispered her name without sound.

2094
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:55,599
halls whispered her name without sound.

2095
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,550
halls whispered her name without sound. Psyche stepped through the threshold,

2096
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:58,560
Psyche stepped through the threshold,

2097
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,550
Psyche stepped through the threshold, expecting fear, but finding peace.

2098
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
expecting fear, but finding peace.

2099
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,390
expecting fear, but finding peace. Servants she couldn't see guided her

2100
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:04,400
Servants she couldn't see guided her

2101
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,870
Servants she couldn't see guided her hands, washed her feet, placed robes

2102
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:06,880
hands, washed her feet, placed robes

2103
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,430
hands, washed her feet, placed robes upon her shoulders. Food appeared, warm

2104
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:09,440
upon her shoulders. Food appeared, warm

2105
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,349
upon her shoulders. Food appeared, warm and fragrant, though no one set the

2106
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:11,359
and fragrant, though no one set the

2107
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,790
and fragrant, though no one set the table. At night, a voice, deep, tender,

2108
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:14,800
table. At night, a voice, deep, tender,

2109
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,309
table. At night, a voice, deep, tender, and kind, spoke from the shadows.

2110
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:18,319
and kind, spoke from the shadows.

2111
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,510
and kind, spoke from the shadows. Do not be afraid. You are safe. This is

2112
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:21,520
Do not be afraid. You are safe. This is

2113
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,790
Do not be afraid. You are safe. This is your home. It was him, her unseen

2114
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:24,800
your home. It was him, her unseen

2115
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,950
your home. It was him, her unseen husband, the one the oracle had

2116
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:26,960
husband, the one the oracle had

2117
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,349
husband, the one the oracle had promised. But there was no snarling

2118
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:29,359
promised. But there was no snarling

2119
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,270
promised. But there was no snarling beast, no monstrous form, just a voice.

2120
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:33,280
beast, no monstrous form, just a voice.

2121
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,670
beast, no monstrous form, just a voice. And strangely, it didn't frighten her.

2122
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:35,680
And strangely, it didn't frighten her.

2123
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,910
And strangely, it didn't frighten her. He never revealed himself, not even in

2124
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:37,920
He never revealed himself, not even in

2125
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,870
He never revealed himself, not even in darkness. Each night he joined her in

2126
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880
darkness. Each night he joined her in

2127
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,430
darkness. Each night he joined her in the quiet velvet of the bed chamber. He

2128
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:43,440
the quiet velvet of the bed chamber. He

2129
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,750
the quiet velvet of the bed chamber. He touched her face like a dream. He

2130
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:45,760
touched her face like a dream. He

2131
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,470
touched her face like a dream. He whispered laughter in her ear. And each

2132
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
whispered laughter in her ear. And each

2133
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,550
whispered laughter in her ear. And each morning, he was gone before the sun

2134
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:50,560
morning, he was gone before the sun

2135
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,349
morning, he was gone before the sun rose. She was falling fast. Love without

2136
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
rose. She was falling fast. Love without

2137
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,030
rose. She was falling fast. Love without sight, intimacy without form. Each word

2138
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,040
sight, intimacy without form. Each word

2139
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,510
sight, intimacy without form. Each word he spoke made her ache for more. But the

2140
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:01,520
he spoke made her ache for more. But the

2141
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,990
he spoke made her ache for more. But the one thing he always begged was this.

2142
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,000
one thing he always begged was this.

2143
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,430
one thing he always begged was this. Never try to see me. She asked once

2144
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
Never try to see me. She asked once

2145
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,950
Never try to see me. She asked once gently, "Why?" The voice tensed, "If you

2146
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:10,960
gently, "Why?" The voice tensed, "If you

2147
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,990
gently, "Why?" The voice tensed, "If you see me, I must leave you forever." And

2148
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,000
see me, I must leave you forever." And

2149
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,790
see me, I must leave you forever." And so she obeyed. But the mystery grew

2150
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:16,800
so she obeyed. But the mystery grew

2151
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,430
so she obeyed. But the mystery grew heavier with each passing day. How could

2152
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:19,440
heavier with each passing day. How could

2153
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,349
heavier with each passing day. How could such a kind, thoughtful man be the

2154
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:21,359
such a kind, thoughtful man be the

2155
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,309
such a kind, thoughtful man be the monster the oracle warned of? Why must

2156
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
monster the oracle warned of? Why must

2157
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,829
monster the oracle warned of? Why must love hide its face? And why, when she

2158
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
love hide its face? And why, when she

2159
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,550
love hide its face? And why, when she whispered her name, did he never whisper

2160
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,560
whispered her name, did he never whisper

2161
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,190
whispered her name, did he never whisper his? Psyche told herself it didn't

2162
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,200
his? Psyche told herself it didn't

2163
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,990
his? Psyche told herself it didn't matter, that she didn't need to know.

2164
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:36,000
matter, that she didn't need to know.

2165
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,550
matter, that she didn't need to know. But the human heart is a curious thing.

2166
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:38,560
But the human heart is a curious thing.

2167
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,349
But the human heart is a curious thing. And the seeds of doubt, once planted,

2168
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:41,359
And the seeds of doubt, once planted,

2169
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,910
And the seeds of doubt, once planted, never stay buried for long, especially

2170
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:43,920
never stay buried for long, especially

2171
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,309
never stay buried for long, especially when family comes to visit. and

2172
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
when family comes to visit. and

2173
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,069
when family comes to visit. and especially when sisters come bearing

2174
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
especially when sisters come bearing

2175
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,030
especially when sisters come bearing poison disguised as love. It had been

2176
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,040
poison disguised as love. It had been

2177
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,150
poison disguised as love. It had been weeks, perhaps months. Time moved

2178
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,160
weeks, perhaps months. Time moved

2179
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,470
weeks, perhaps months. Time moved strangely in the invisible palace.

2180
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,480
strangely in the invisible palace.

2181
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,390
strangely in the invisible palace. Psyche knew peace, laughter, luxury, and

2182
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,400
Psyche knew peace, laughter, luxury, and

2183
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,829
Psyche knew peace, laughter, luxury, and love. But she also knew isolation. No

2184
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:03,839
love. But she also knew isolation. No

2185
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,790
love. But she also knew isolation. No faces, no names, no truth, just a voice

2186
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:06,800
faces, no names, no truth, just a voice

2187
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,710
faces, no names, no truth, just a voice in the dark and shadows that kissed her

2188
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:08,720
in the dark and shadows that kissed her

2189
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,230
in the dark and shadows that kissed her lips. Then one morning, her husband's

2190
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:12,240
lips. Then one morning, her husband's

2191
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,150
lips. Then one morning, her husband's voice was different.

2192
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:14,160
voice was different.

2193
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,470
voice was different. Sorrow will follow if you see them, he

2194
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:16,480
Sorrow will follow if you see them, he

2195
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,550
Sorrow will follow if you see them, he said. See who? Your sisters. They

2196
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:20,560
said. See who? Your sisters. They

2197
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,950
said. See who? Your sisters. They believe they come out of love. But what

2198
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:22,960
believe they come out of love. But what

2199
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,190
believe they come out of love. But what they bring is ruin.

2200
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,200
they bring is ruin.

2201
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,230
they bring is ruin. Psyche's heart cracked. She missed them.

2202
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
Psyche's heart cracked. She missed them.

2203
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,790
Psyche's heart cracked. She missed them. Their teasing, their warmth, even their

2204
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:30,800
Their teasing, their warmth, even their

2205
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,030
Their teasing, their warmth, even their jealousy. They were her last connection

2206
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,040
jealousy. They were her last connection

2207
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,349
jealousy. They were her last connection to the mortal world, to the girl she

2208
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:35,359
to the mortal world, to the girl she

2209
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,510
to the mortal world, to the girl she used to be before gods and palaces and

2210
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:37,520
used to be before gods and palaces and

2211
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,950
used to be before gods and palaces and mystery husbands. She pleaded, "Let me

2212
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:40,960
mystery husbands. She pleaded, "Let me

2213
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,349
mystery husbands. She pleaded, "Let me see them, please. just once. Aos

2214
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
see them, please. just once. Aos

2215
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,750
see them, please. just once. Aos hesitated, but he could never deny her.

2216
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
hesitated, but he could never deny her.

2217
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,109
hesitated, but he could never deny her. He agreed with one warning. Do not let

2218
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,119
He agreed with one warning. Do not let

2219
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,750
He agreed with one warning. Do not let their words poison what we have. They

2220
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:53,760
their words poison what we have. They

2221
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,230
their words poison what we have. They will try to unravel your trust. You must

2222
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
will try to unravel your trust. You must

2223
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,670
will try to unravel your trust. You must not listen. And so the winds that once

2224
00:47:59,670 --> 00:47:59,680
not listen. And so the winds that once

2225
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,990
not listen. And so the winds that once lifted Psyche carried her sisters to the

2226
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,000
lifted Psyche carried her sisters to the

2227
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,950
lifted Psyche carried her sisters to the garden gates of the invisible palace.

2228
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:04,960
garden gates of the invisible palace.

2229
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,910
garden gates of the invisible palace. When they saw her, they were stunned.

2230
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:07,920
When they saw her, they were stunned.

2231
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,150
When they saw her, they were stunned. She was alive, more than alive, radiant,

2232
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,160
She was alive, more than alive, radiant,

2233
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,870
She was alive, more than alive, radiant, draped in silks finer than any queen,

2234
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:14,880
draped in silks finer than any queen,

2235
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,670
draped in silks finer than any queen, her skin glowing like starlight.

2236
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:17,680
her skin glowing like starlight.

2237
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,230
her skin glowing like starlight. They embraced her, laughing nervously,

2238
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:20,240
They embraced her, laughing nervously,

2239
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,990
They embraced her, laughing nervously, hiding their envy beneath brittle

2240
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:22,000
hiding their envy beneath brittle

2241
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,349
hiding their envy beneath brittle smiles. "Where is your husband?" one

2242
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:25,359
smiles. "Where is your husband?" one

2243
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,349
smiles. "Where is your husband?" one asked. Psyche smiled. "He comes only at

2244
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:29,359
asked. Psyche smiled. "He comes only at

2245
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,829
asked. Psyche smiled. "He comes only at night. I've never seen him." The sisters

2246
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:31,839
night. I've never seen him." The sisters

2247
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,790
night. I've never seen him." The sisters froze. "You've never seen him?" she

2248
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:34,800
froze. "You've never seen him?" she

2249
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,470
froze. "You've never seen him?" she nodded. He won't let you see his face.

2250
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:38,480
nodded. He won't let you see his face.

2251
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,990
nodded. He won't let you see his face. The other gasped. What if he's hideous?

2252
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,000
The other gasped. What if he's hideous?

2253
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,549
The other gasped. What if he's hideous? A beast? Or worse, what if he's one of

2254
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:44,559
A beast? Or worse, what if he's one of

2255
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,230
A beast? Or worse, what if he's one of the gods using you and laughing behind

2256
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:46,240
the gods using you and laughing behind

2257
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,910
the gods using you and laughing behind your back?

2258
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,920
your back?

2259
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,309
your back? Their voices dripped with sweet concern,

2260
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:50,319
Their voices dripped with sweet concern,

2261
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,030
Their voices dripped with sweet concern, but Psyche felt the change. The old

2262
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,040
but Psyche felt the change. The old

2263
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,670
but Psyche felt the change. The old sibling rivalry was still there, now

2264
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
sibling rivalry was still there, now

2265
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,309
sibling rivalry was still there, now twisted into something darker.

2266
00:48:58,309 --> 00:48:58,319
twisted into something darker.

2267
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,190
twisted into something darker. Jealousy sharpened their words. "He

2268
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:01,200
Jealousy sharpened their words. "He

2269
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,710
Jealousy sharpened their words. "He keeps you hidden, blind, dependent. Is

2270
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:04,720
keeps you hidden, blind, dependent. Is

2271
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,510
keeps you hidden, blind, dependent. Is that love or imprisonment?

2272
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:07,520
that love or imprisonment?

2273
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,390
that love or imprisonment? The seed of doubt was planted. They saw

2274
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:10,400
The seed of doubt was planted. They saw

2275
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,069
The seed of doubt was planted. They saw it take root and they smiled. As they

2276
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:14,079
it take root and they smiled. As they

2277
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,990
it take root and they smiled. As they left, they kissed her cheeks and

2278
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,000
left, they kissed her cheeks and

2279
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,790
left, they kissed her cheeks and whispered, "Just take a lamp one night.

2280
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:18,800
whispered, "Just take a lamp one night.

2281
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,910
whispered, "Just take a lamp one night. See for yourself. If he loves you, what

2282
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:21,920
See for yourself. If he loves you, what

2283
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,030
See for yourself. If he loves you, what harm can truth do?" Psyche watched them

2284
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,040
harm can truth do?" Psyche watched them

2285
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,349
harm can truth do?" Psyche watched them disappear into the wind. And for the

2286
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,359
disappear into the wind. And for the

2287
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,670
disappear into the wind. And for the first time since arriving in paradise,

2288
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:29,680
first time since arriving in paradise,

2289
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,150
first time since arriving in paradise, she couldn't stop shaking. Not from

2290
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,160
she couldn't stop shaking. Not from

2291
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,790
she couldn't stop shaking. Not from fear, from curiosity.

2292
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
fear, from curiosity.

2293
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,910
fear, from curiosity. That night, Psyche couldn't sleep. She

2294
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:37,920
That night, Psyche couldn't sleep. She

2295
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,470
That night, Psyche couldn't sleep. She lay in the dark, wrapped in silk sheets,

2296
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:40,480
lay in the dark, wrapped in silk sheets,

2297
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,030
lay in the dark, wrapped in silk sheets, his arms gently curled around her, his

2298
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,040
his arms gently curled around her, his

2299
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,910
his arms gently curled around her, his breath steady beside hers, but her mind

2300
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:45,920
breath steady beside hers, but her mind

2301
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,190
breath steady beside hers, but her mind was loud, louder than his heart, louder

2302
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,200
was loud, louder than his heart, louder

2303
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,589
was loud, louder than his heart, louder than love. Her sister's words kept

2304
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
than love. Her sister's words kept

2305
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,309
than love. Her sister's words kept repeating like a spell. What if he's a

2306
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,319
repeating like a spell. What if he's a

2307
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,470
repeating like a spell. What if he's a monster? What if he's using you? What if

2308
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:58,480
monster? What if he's using you? What if

2309
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,190
monster? What if he's using you? What if he's not who you think he is?

2310
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
he's not who you think he is?

2311
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,829
he's not who you think he is? She had trusted blindly. She had given

2312
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
She had trusted blindly. She had given

2313
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,309
She had trusted blindly. She had given herself completely to a voice in the

2314
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
herself completely to a voice in the

2315
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,109
herself completely to a voice in the dark. But was that love or simply

2316
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:09,119
dark. But was that love or simply

2317
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,990
dark. But was that love or simply surrender? She slipped from the bed,

2318
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
surrender? She slipped from the bed,

2319
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,030
surrender? She slipped from the bed, silent as snowfall. Her bare feet kissed

2320
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
silent as snowfall. Her bare feet kissed

2321
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,230
silent as snowfall. Her bare feet kissed the cold floor, and in her hand she held

2322
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,240
the cold floor, and in her hand she held

2323
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,710
the cold floor, and in her hand she held a small bronze oil lamp, its wick

2324
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
a small bronze oil lamp, its wick

2325
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,589
a small bronze oil lamp, its wick already lit. Her heart thundered in her

2326
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:23,599
already lit. Her heart thundered in her

2327
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,990
already lit. Her heart thundered in her chest as she approached. Her fingers

2328
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,000
chest as she approached. Her fingers

2329
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,549
chest as she approached. Her fingers trembled as she leaned in. And when the

2330
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:28,559
trembled as she leaned in. And when the

2331
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,230
trembled as she leaned in. And when the light reached his face, she gasped. Not

2332
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:32,240
light reached his face, she gasped. Not

2333
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,109
light reached his face, she gasped. Not a monster, not a god in disguise. A man

2334
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:37,119
a monster, not a god in disguise. A man

2335
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,309
a monster, not a god in disguise. A man beautiful beyond words. Golden curls

2336
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:40,319
beautiful beyond words. Golden curls

2337
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,630
beautiful beyond words. Golden curls tangled on the pillow, soft lips curved

2338
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
tangled on the pillow, soft lips curved

2339
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,829
tangled on the pillow, soft lips curved in sleep, and on his back, wings

2340
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:45,839
in sleep, and on his back, wings

2341
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,270
in sleep, and on his back, wings feathered, divine, folded like a secret.

2342
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:49,280
feathered, divine, folded like a secret.

2343
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,549
feathered, divine, folded like a secret. This was OS, the god of love, and he had

2344
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:52,559
This was OS, the god of love, and he had

2345
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,750
This was OS, the god of love, and he had chosen her. her eyes filled with tears,

2346
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:55,760
chosen her. her eyes filled with tears,

2347
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,030
chosen her. her eyes filled with tears, not from fear, but from guilt. He had

2348
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,040
not from fear, but from guilt. He had

2349
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,390
not from fear, but from guilt. He had trusted her, warned her, loved her, and

2350
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,400
trusted her, warned her, loved her, and

2351
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,510
trusted her, warned her, loved her, and she had doubted. She leaned closer,

2352
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:05,520
she had doubted. She leaned closer,

2353
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,990
she had doubted. She leaned closer, wanting to kiss his lips, to whisper an

2354
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:08,000
wanting to kiss his lips, to whisper an

2355
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,549
wanting to kiss his lips, to whisper an apology before the light was gone. But

2356
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:10,559
apology before the light was gone. But

2357
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,309
apology before the light was gone. But fate is cruel. A single drop of hot oil

2358
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:14,319
fate is cruel. A single drop of hot oil

2359
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,910
fate is cruel. A single drop of hot oil spilled from the lamp and touched his

2360
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:15,920
spilled from the lamp and touched his

2361
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,309
spilled from the lamp and touched his bare shoulder. He awoke with a cry of

2362
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:18,319
bare shoulder. He awoke with a cry of

2363
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,270
bare shoulder. He awoke with a cry of pain and betrayal. His wings flared

2364
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:21,280
pain and betrayal. His wings flared

2365
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,309
pain and betrayal. His wings flared open, his eyes wide with heartbreak.

2366
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:24,319
open, his eyes wide with heartbreak.

2367
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,950
open, his eyes wide with heartbreak. "You broke your promise," he said, voice

2368
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:26,960
"You broke your promise," he said, voice

2369
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,670
"You broke your promise," he said, voice hollow. "You trusted fear more than

2370
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,680
hollow. "You trusted fear more than

2371
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,030
hollow. "You trusted fear more than love." "I'm sorry," Psyche whispered,

2372
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:33,040
love." "I'm sorry," Psyche whispered,

2373
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,670
love." "I'm sorry," Psyche whispered, falling to her knees. "I just wanted to

2374
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:35,680
falling to her knees. "I just wanted to

2375
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,950
falling to her knees. "I just wanted to know," Aeros stepped back, his glow

2376
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:38,960
know," Aeros stepped back, his glow

2377
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,870
know," Aeros stepped back, his glow dimming. "Now you do." And with that, he

2378
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:42,880
dimming. "Now you do." And with that, he

2379
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,190
dimming. "Now you do." And with that, he vanished into the darkness.

2380
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
vanished into the darkness.

2381
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,910
vanished into the darkness. The palace crumbled behind him. The

2382
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:47,920
The palace crumbled behind him. The

2383
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,069
The palace crumbled behind him. The invisible world they'd shared unraveled

2384
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
invisible world they'd shared unraveled

2385
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,150
invisible world they'd shared unraveled like smoke.

2386
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
like smoke.

2387
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,990
like smoke. Psyche was left alone on a barren

2388
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,000
Psyche was left alone on a barren

2389
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,230
Psyche was left alone on a barren hillside, the lamp still warm in her

2390
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
hillside, the lamp still warm in her

2391
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,510
hillside, the lamp still warm in her hand and her heart shattered. She had

2392
00:51:59,510 --> 00:51:59,520
hand and her heart shattered. She had

2393
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,190
hand and her heart shattered. She had seen the god of love and lost him, not

2394
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,200
seen the god of love and lost him, not

2395
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,109
seen the god of love and lost him, not to fate, but to doubt. Psyche wandered

2396
00:52:07,109 --> 00:52:07,119
to fate, but to doubt. Psyche wandered

2397
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,670
to fate, but to doubt. Psyche wandered barefoot and broken across a world that

2398
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:09,680
barefoot and broken across a world that

2399
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,230
barefoot and broken across a world that suddenly seemed colder. The lush

2400
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:12,240
suddenly seemed colder. The lush

2401
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,790
suddenly seemed colder. The lush gardens, the silken halls, the voice

2402
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:14,800
gardens, the silken halls, the voice

2403
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,470
gardens, the silken halls, the voice that once lulled her to sleep, gone. The

2404
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,480
that once lulled her to sleep, gone. The

2405
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,430
that once lulled her to sleep, gone. The sky offered no answer. The earth gave no

2406
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:21,440
sky offered no answer. The earth gave no

2407
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,030
sky offered no answer. The earth gave no comfort. Only her regret remained. Each

2408
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,040
comfort. Only her regret remained. Each

2409
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,990
comfort. Only her regret remained. Each step was heavy with sorrow. She called

2410
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:28,000
step was heavy with sorrow. She called

2411
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,309
step was heavy with sorrow. She called out to Os in forests, in fields, in

2412
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:30,319
out to Os in forests, in fields, in

2413
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,270
out to Os in forests, in fields, in rivers, even in dreams. But there was no

2414
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:33,280
rivers, even in dreams. But there was no

2415
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,230
rivers, even in dreams. But there was no reply. The god of love had vanished, not

2416
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:36,240
reply. The god of love had vanished, not

2417
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,910
reply. The god of love had vanished, not from Olympus, but from her life. In

2418
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:39,920
from Olympus, but from her life. In

2419
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,230
from Olympus, but from her life. In desperation, Psyche returned to her

2420
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,240
desperation, Psyche returned to her

2421
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,109
desperation, Psyche returned to her father's home. But the palace that once

2422
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:45,119
father's home. But the palace that once

2423
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,309
father's home. But the palace that once cherished her now whispered with rumors.

2424
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:48,319
cherished her now whispered with rumors.

2425
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,030
cherished her now whispered with rumors. Her sisters, triumphant in her misery,

2426
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,040
Her sisters, triumphant in her misery,

2427
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,270
Her sisters, triumphant in her misery, claimed she had married a demon and lost

2428
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,280
claimed she had married a demon and lost

2429
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,069
claimed she had married a demon and lost everything. No one believed her tale of

2430
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
everything. No one believed her tale of

2431
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,950
everything. No one believed her tale of love and gods and winged husbands. So

2432
00:52:58,950 --> 00:52:58,960
love and gods and winged husbands. So

2433
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,910
love and gods and winged husbands. So she left again. This time not out of

2434
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:01,920
she left again. This time not out of

2435
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,990
she left again. This time not out of exile, but purpose. She would find OS,

2436
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,000
exile, but purpose. She would find OS,

2437
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,470
exile, but purpose. She would find OS, no matter how far she had to go, no

2438
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
no matter how far she had to go, no

2439
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,030
no matter how far she had to go, no matter what wrath she might face, even

2440
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,040
matter what wrath she might face, even

2441
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,309
matter what wrath she might face, even if it meant entering Olympus itself. But

2442
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:14,319
if it meant entering Olympus itself. But

2443
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,990
if it meant entering Olympus itself. But mortals don't simply walk into the

2444
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,000
mortals don't simply walk into the

2445
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,470
mortals don't simply walk into the heavens. So, she sought the only one who

2446
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:18,480
heavens. So, she sought the only one who

2447
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,790
heavens. So, she sought the only one who might guide her path, the one who had

2448
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:20,800
might guide her path, the one who had

2449
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,069
might guide her path, the one who had started it all, Aphroditi.

2450
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:24,079
started it all, Aphroditi.

2451
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,910
started it all, Aphroditi. Yes, Psyche was afraid. The goddess had

2452
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:27,920
Yes, Psyche was afraid. The goddess had

2453
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,390
Yes, Psyche was afraid. The goddess had reason to hate her. But if Aeros still

2454
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:30,400
reason to hate her. But if Aeros still

2455
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,790
reason to hate her. But if Aeros still loved her, if there was even a sliver of

2456
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,800
loved her, if there was even a sliver of

2457
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,790
loved her, if there was even a sliver of hope, then Psyche would face even the

2458
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:34,800
hope, then Psyche would face even the

2459
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,670
hope, then Psyche would face even the wrath of Olympus to earn redemption.

2460
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:37,680
wrath of Olympus to earn redemption.

2461
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,670
wrath of Olympus to earn redemption. She found Aphrodite not in a golden

2462
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:39,680
She found Aphrodite not in a golden

2463
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,670
She found Aphrodite not in a golden temple, but in a private garden

2464
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,680
temple, but in a private garden

2465
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,230
temple, but in a private garden surrounded by mirrors. The goddess

2466
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:44,240
surrounded by mirrors. The goddess

2467
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,549
surrounded by mirrors. The goddess looked into her own reflection as if

2468
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
looked into her own reflection as if

2469
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,349
looked into her own reflection as if searching for floors that didn't exist.

2470
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:49,359
searching for floors that didn't exist.

2471
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,069
searching for floors that didn't exist. When Psyche approached, Aphrodite didn't

2472
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,079
When Psyche approached, Aphrodite didn't

2473
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,190
When Psyche approached, Aphrodite didn't turn. "I warned you once," the goddess

2474
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:55,200
turn. "I warned you once," the goddess

2475
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,230
turn. "I warned you once," the goddess said coldly. And still you touched what

2476
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
said coldly. And still you touched what

2477
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,910
said coldly. And still you touched what was mine.

2478
00:53:59,910 --> 00:53:59,920
was mine.

2479
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,910
was mine. Psyche knelt. I love him. Aphrodite

2480
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:03,920
Psyche knelt. I love him. Aphrodite

2481
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,870
Psyche knelt. I love him. Aphrodite laughed. You love him? You mean the son

2482
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:06,880
laughed. You love him? You mean the son

2483
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,549
laughed. You love him? You mean the son you betrayed? The god you doubted? I was

2484
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
you betrayed? The god you doubted? I was

2485
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,349
you betrayed? The god you doubted? I was foolish, Psyche admitted. But I will do

2486
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:13,359
foolish, Psyche admitted. But I will do

2487
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,750
foolish, Psyche admitted. But I will do anything to earn back his trust.

2488
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
anything to earn back his trust.

2489
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,309
anything to earn back his trust. Aphrodite turned, her eyes sharp as

2490
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
Aphrodite turned, her eyes sharp as

2491
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,950
Aphrodite turned, her eyes sharp as blades. Anything?

2492
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:20,960
blades. Anything?

2493
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,670
blades. Anything? Psyche nodded. The goddess smiled, but

2494
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:23,680
Psyche nodded. The goddess smiled, but

2495
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,710
Psyche nodded. The goddess smiled, but it was not kind. then you will suffer.

2496
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:26,720
it was not kind. then you will suffer.

2497
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,829
it was not kind. then you will suffer. You will be tested. And perhaps perhaps

2498
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
You will be tested. And perhaps perhaps

2499
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,750
You will be tested. And perhaps perhaps at the end of your agony, you'll be

2500
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:31,760
at the end of your agony, you'll be

2501
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,190
at the end of your agony, you'll be worthy of my son. Thus began a trial not

2502
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,200
worthy of my son. Thus began a trial not

2503
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,230
worthy of my son. Thus began a trial not of strength, but of devotion, and Psyche

2504
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:38,240
of strength, but of devotion, and Psyche

2505
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,270
of strength, but of devotion, and Psyche would have to face it alone. Aphrodite

2506
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
would have to face it alone. Aphrodite

2507
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,589
would have to face it alone. Aphrodite didn't waste time. Her beauty was

2508
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:43,599
didn't waste time. Her beauty was

2509
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,150
didn't waste time. Her beauty was legendary, but her cruelty, when

2510
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,160
legendary, but her cruelty, when

2511
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,990
legendary, but her cruelty, when provoked, was equally divine. If Psyche

2512
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:50,000
provoked, was equally divine. If Psyche

2513
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,470
provoked, was equally divine. If Psyche wanted even a chance to see Aeros again,

2514
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
wanted even a chance to see Aeros again,

2515
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,990
wanted even a chance to see Aeros again, she would have to prove her worth

2516
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000
she would have to prove her worth

2517
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,870
she would have to prove her worth through a series of impossible trials.

2518
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:56,880
through a series of impossible trials.

2519
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,990
through a series of impossible trials. The first task was deceptively simple.

2520
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,000
The first task was deceptively simple.

2521
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,309
The first task was deceptively simple. Aphroditi led her to a vast storage

2522
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:02,319
Aphroditi led her to a vast storage

2523
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,870
Aphroditi led her to a vast storage chamber where mountains of seeds spilled

2524
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:04,880
chamber where mountains of seeds spilled

2525
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,589
chamber where mountains of seeds spilled across the floor. Barley, millet,

2526
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:07,599
across the floor. Barley, millet,

2527
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,109
across the floor. Barley, millet, lentils, poppy, wheat, and beans all

2528
00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:11,119
lentils, poppy, wheat, and beans all

2529
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,430
lentils, poppy, wheat, and beans all mixed together into an indistinguishable

2530
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,440
mixed together into an indistinguishable

2531
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,950
mixed together into an indistinguishable chaos.

2532
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:14,960
chaos.

2533
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,349
chaos. By nightfall, Aphrodite said with a

2534
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:17,359
By nightfall, Aphrodite said with a

2535
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,270
By nightfall, Aphrodite said with a yawn, "Separate them, every grain, every

2536
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:21,280
yawn, "Separate them, every grain, every

2537
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,190
yawn, "Separate them, every grain, every seed, into its proper pile. If you fail,

2538
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
seed, into its proper pile. If you fail,

2539
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,390
seed, into its proper pile. If you fail, you'll never see my son again." Then she

2540
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:28,400
you'll never see my son again." Then she

2541
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,670
you'll never see my son again." Then she left, humming to herself. Psyche stared

2542
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:31,680
left, humming to herself. Psyche stared

2543
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,470
left, humming to herself. Psyche stared at the impossible task. Even a thousand

2544
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:34,480
at the impossible task. Even a thousand

2545
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,150
at the impossible task. Even a thousand hands wouldn't be enough to sort such a

2546
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,160
hands wouldn't be enough to sort such a

2547
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,030
hands wouldn't be enough to sort such a mess in a day. She knelt anyway and

2548
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,040
mess in a day. She knelt anyway and

2549
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,589
mess in a day. She knelt anyway and began, picking seed after seed, her

2550
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
began, picking seed after seed, her

2551
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,309
began, picking seed after seed, her fingers shaking. Minutes passed like

2552
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
fingers shaking. Minutes passed like

2553
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,430
fingers shaking. Minutes passed like hours. Her eyes blurred. She wasn't even

2554
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,440
hours. Her eyes blurred. She wasn't even

2555
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,589
hours. Her eyes blurred. She wasn't even a fraction of the way through. But the

2556
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:49,599
a fraction of the way through. But the

2557
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,910
a fraction of the way through. But the gods are always watching. And so are

2558
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:51,920
gods are always watching. And so are

2559
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,829
gods are always watching. And so are their creatures.

2560
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:53,839
their creatures.

2561
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,470
their creatures. Unseen by psyche, a line of ants had

2562
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:56,480
Unseen by psyche, a line of ants had

2563
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,789
Unseen by psyche, a line of ants had been watching her toil. Not just any

2564
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
been watching her toil. Not just any

2565
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,750
been watching her toil. Not just any ants, these were sacred to Deita,

2566
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:01,760
ants, these were sacred to Deita,

2567
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,150
ants, these were sacred to Deita, goddess of the harvest. Perhaps they

2568
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:04,160
goddess of the harvest. Perhaps they

2569
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,549
goddess of the harvest. Perhaps they pied the girl. Perhaps they were moved

2570
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:06,559
pied the girl. Perhaps they were moved

2571
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,069
pied the girl. Perhaps they were moved by love. In a sudden flurry of motion,

2572
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
by love. In a sudden flurry of motion,

2573
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,230
by love. In a sudden flurry of motion, hundreds of tiny legs raced across the

2574
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,240
hundreds of tiny legs raced across the

2575
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,030
hundreds of tiny legs raced across the floor. The ants formed living rivers,

2576
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,040
floor. The ants formed living rivers,

2577
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,630
floor. The ants formed living rivers, dividing the seeds with shocking

2578
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640
dividing the seeds with shocking

2579
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,829
dividing the seeds with shocking precision. In minutes, the chaos became

2580
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:19,839
precision. In minutes, the chaos became

2581
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:23,829
precision. In minutes, the chaos became order. Barley to one side, lentils to

2582
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:23,839
order. Barley to one side, lentils to

2583
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,870
order. Barley to one side, lentils to another, millet in neat pyramids. It was

2584
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:26,880
another, millet in neat pyramids. It was

2585
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,030
another, millet in neat pyramids. It was like watching nature itself rewrite the

2586
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,040
like watching nature itself rewrite the

2587
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,230
like watching nature itself rewrite the laws of time. When Aphrodite returned at

2588
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,240
laws of time. When Aphrodite returned at

2589
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,950
laws of time. When Aphrodite returned at dusk, she was met not with failure, but

2590
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:34,960
dusk, she was met not with failure, but

2591
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,150
dusk, she was met not with failure, but perfection. She narrowed her eyes. "You

2592
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:38,160
perfection. She narrowed her eyes. "You

2593
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,349
perfection. She narrowed her eyes. "You had help," she snapped. Psyche bowed her

2594
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:41,359
had help," she snapped. Psyche bowed her

2595
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,549
had help," she snapped. Psyche bowed her head. "I only did what I could."

2596
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:44,559
head. "I only did what I could."

2597
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,549
head. "I only did what I could." Aphrodite's lips twitched with something

2598
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
Aphrodite's lips twitched with something

2599
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,270
Aphrodite's lips twitched with something between anger and amusement. She hadn't

2600
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
between anger and amusement. She hadn't

2601
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,030
between anger and amusement. She hadn't expected the mortal girl to complete the

2602
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,040
expected the mortal girl to complete the

2603
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,670
expected the mortal girl to complete the task, much less with grace. But no

2604
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:53,680
task, much less with grace. But no

2605
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,750
task, much less with grace. But no matter, there were still many more

2606
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:55,760
matter, there were still many more

2607
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,349
matter, there were still many more trials to go, harder ones, deadlier

2608
00:56:59,349 --> 00:56:59,359
trials to go, harder ones, deadlier

2609
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,309
trials to go, harder ones, deadlier ones. "This was only the beginning," the

2610
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:02,319
ones. "This was only the beginning," the

2611
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,950
ones. "This was only the beginning," the goddess warned. If you want to see Aeros

2612
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:04,960
goddess warned. If you want to see Aeros

2613
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,910
goddess warned. If you want to see Aeros again, you'll need more than luck. And

2614
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:07,920
again, you'll need more than luck. And

2615
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,030
again, you'll need more than luck. And yet Psyche, exhausted, sore, but

2616
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,040
yet Psyche, exhausted, sore, but

2617
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,670
yet Psyche, exhausted, sore, but standing, nodded.

2618
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:13,680
standing, nodded.

2619
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,470
standing, nodded. I'll do whatever it takes.

2620
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:16,480
I'll do whatever it takes.

2621
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,670
I'll do whatever it takes. Because love, true love, was worth more

2622
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
Because love, true love, was worth more

2623
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,630
Because love, true love, was worth more than divine comfort or mortal pride. And

2624
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:22,640
than divine comfort or mortal pride. And

2625
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,829
than divine comfort or mortal pride. And Psyche's war had only just begun. Psyche

2626
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:25,839
Psyche's war had only just begun. Psyche

2627
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,150
Psyche's war had only just begun. Psyche barely had time to rest before Aphrodite

2628
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,160
barely had time to rest before Aphrodite

2629
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,470
barely had time to rest before Aphrodite handed her the second task. This one

2630
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:30,480
handed her the second task. This one

2631
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,670
handed her the second task. This one even cruer in its design.

2632
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:33,680
even cruer in its design.

2633
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,910
even cruer in its design. See that river down there?" the goddess

2634
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:35,920
See that river down there?" the goddess

2635
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,309
See that river down there?" the goddess asked, pointing to a winding stream

2636
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:38,319
asked, pointing to a winding stream

2637
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,589
asked, pointing to a winding stream glinting beneath the afternoon sun. It

2638
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:41,599
glinting beneath the afternoon sun. It

2639
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,589
glinting beneath the afternoon sun. It runs beside a meadow where wild rams

2640
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:43,599
runs beside a meadow where wild rams

2641
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,950
runs beside a meadow where wild rams graze. Their wool is made of gold. Bring

2642
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:46,960
graze. Their wool is made of gold. Bring

2643
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,230
graze. Their wool is made of gold. Bring me a tuft of it, just a handful, but do

2644
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,240
me a tuft of it, just a handful, but do

2645
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,030
me a tuft of it, just a handful, but do try not to die. She smirked and

2646
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
try not to die. She smirked and

2647
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,349
try not to die. She smirked and vanished, leaving Psyche to face what

2648
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:55,359
vanished, leaving Psyche to face what

2649
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,990
vanished, leaving Psyche to face what she knew was more than a simple chore.

2650
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:58,000
she knew was more than a simple chore.

2651
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,630
she knew was more than a simple chore. These were no gentle creatures. The

2652
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:00,640
These were no gentle creatures. The

2653
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,750
These were no gentle creatures. The golden rams were sacred, their eyes wild

2654
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:03,760
golden rams were sacred, their eyes wild

2655
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,870
golden rams were sacred, their eyes wild and their horns sharp as spears. They

2656
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:06,880
and their horns sharp as spears. They

2657
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,710
and their horns sharp as spears. They were known to gore anything that entered

2658
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:08,720
were known to gore anything that entered

2659
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,950
were known to gore anything that entered their field, tearing intruders apart

2660
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
their field, tearing intruders apart

2661
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,190
their field, tearing intruders apart without warning. They glittered like

2662
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
without warning. They glittered like

2663
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,390
without warning. They glittered like treasure, but guarded it with rage.

2664
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:16,400
treasure, but guarded it with rage.

2665
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,950
treasure, but guarded it with rage. Still, Psyche climbed down the hill and

2666
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:18,960
Still, Psyche climbed down the hill and

2667
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,109
Still, Psyche climbed down the hill and approached the field.

2668
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
approached the field.

2669
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,190
approached the field. She crouched by the reeds, heart

2670
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:23,200
She crouched by the reeds, heart

2671
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,150
She crouched by the reeds, heart pounding, watching the creatures roam.

2672
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:26,160
pounding, watching the creatures roam.

2673
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,870
pounding, watching the creatures roam. Their hooves cracked against stones.

2674
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:28,880
Their hooves cracked against stones.

2675
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,150
Their hooves cracked against stones. Their growls echoed low and primal.

2676
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
Their growls echoed low and primal.

2677
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,670
Their growls echoed low and primal. There was no way she could survive

2678
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,680
There was no way she could survive

2679
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,230
There was no way she could survive entering their territory in daylight.

2680
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:36,240
entering their territory in daylight.

2681
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,109
entering their territory in daylight. She sank to her knees, tears welling,

2682
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:39,119
She sank to her knees, tears welling,

2683
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,230
She sank to her knees, tears welling, fear clawing at her resolve. But once

2684
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
fear clawing at her resolve. But once

2685
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,430
fear clawing at her resolve. But once again, the world watched. A quiet

2686
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:45,440
again, the world watched. A quiet

2687
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,990
again, the world watched. A quiet whisper drifted through the tall grass.

2688
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,000
whisper drifted through the tall grass.

2689
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,030
whisper drifted through the tall grass. A soft voice like reeds swaying in

2690
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,040
A soft voice like reeds swaying in

2691
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,990
A soft voice like reeds swaying in rhythm. It was a spirit of the river, an

2692
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:54,000
rhythm. It was a spirit of the river, an

2693
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,950
rhythm. It was a spirit of the river, an old presence bound to the stream.

2694
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:56,960
old presence bound to the stream.

2695
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,950
old presence bound to the stream. Do not enter the field while the sun is

2696
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:58,960
Do not enter the field while the sun is

2697
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,150
Do not enter the field while the sun is high, the spirit murmured. The rams rage

2698
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,160
high, the spirit murmured. The rams rage

2699
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,710
high, the spirit murmured. The rams rage under daylight. But when twilight falls,

2700
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
under daylight. But when twilight falls,

2701
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,750
under daylight. But when twilight falls, they rest in the shade. Wait, and then

2702
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:07,760
they rest in the shade. Wait, and then

2703
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,670
they rest in the shade. Wait, and then gather the wool from the thorny branches

2704
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:09,680
gather the wool from the thorny branches

2705
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,150
gather the wool from the thorny branches where it has snagged. No beast will miss

2706
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:12,160
where it has snagged. No beast will miss

2707
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,870
where it has snagged. No beast will miss it. Hope returned. Psyche waited. Hours

2708
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:16,880
it. Hope returned. Psyche waited. Hours

2709
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,910
it. Hope returned. Psyche waited. Hours passed. The golden rams one by one

2710
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:19,920
passed. The golden rams one by one

2711
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,829
passed. The golden rams one by one wandered into the trees and settled into

2712
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:21,839
wandered into the trees and settled into

2713
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,710
wandered into the trees and settled into slumber. As darkness fell, she crept

2714
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
slumber. As darkness fell, she crept

2715
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,309
slumber. As darkness fell, she crept forward, quiet, careful, and found tufts

2716
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
forward, quiet, careful, and found tufts

2717
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,549
forward, quiet, careful, and found tufts of golden fleece tangled in brambles and

2718
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:30,559
of golden fleece tangled in brambles and

2719
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,069
of golden fleece tangled in brambles and bark.

2720
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:32,079
bark.

2721
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,470
bark. By moonlight, she gathered the wool and

2722
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:34,480
By moonlight, she gathered the wool and

2723
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,789
By moonlight, she gathered the wool and returned to Aphroditi, who narrowed her

2724
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:36,799
returned to Aphroditi, who narrowed her

2725
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,390
returned to Aphroditi, who narrowed her eyes at the shimmering handful in

2726
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:38,400
eyes at the shimmering handful in

2727
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,549
eyes at the shimmering handful in Psyche's palm.

2728
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:40,559
Psyche's palm.

2729
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,270
Psyche's palm. "You live again," the goddess muttered,

2730
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
"You live again," the goddess muttered,

2731
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,349
"You live again," the goddess muttered, curious.

2732
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:47,359
curious.

2733
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,710
curious. But Psyche said nothing. No pride, no

2734
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
But Psyche said nothing. No pride, no

2735
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,390
But Psyche said nothing. No pride, no gloating, just silent strength because

2736
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:54,400
gloating, just silent strength because

2737
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,150
gloating, just silent strength because love had taught her something even the

2738
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:56,160
love had taught her something even the

2739
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,789
love had taught her something even the gods had forgotten.

2740
00:59:58,789 --> 00:59:58,799
gods had forgotten.

2741
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:02,549
gods had forgotten. Courage grows quiet, but it endures.

2742
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
Courage grows quiet, but it endures.

2743
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,390
Courage grows quiet, but it endures. And though Aphroditi was not finished

2744
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:04,400
And though Aphroditi was not finished

2745
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,109
And though Aphroditi was not finished testing her, Psyche was far from

2746
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:07,119
testing her, Psyche was far from

2747
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,829
testing her, Psyche was far from finished fighting. Aphrodite was growing

2748
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839
finished fighting. Aphrodite was growing

2749
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,870
finished fighting. Aphrodite was growing frustrated. Psyche had survived tasks

2750
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:12,880
frustrated. Psyche had survived tasks

2751
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,950
frustrated. Psyche had survived tasks meant to crush her, using nothing but

2752
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:14,960
meant to crush her, using nothing but

2753
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,150
meant to crush her, using nothing but determination and a strange, unshakable

2754
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
determination and a strange, unshakable

2755
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,990
determination and a strange, unshakable luck. The goddess's smile was gone now,

2756
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,000
luck. The goddess's smile was gone now,

2757
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,630
luck. The goddess's smile was gone now, replaced by cold calculation.

2758
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:24,640
replaced by cold calculation.

2759
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,349
replaced by cold calculation. And so, for the third trial, she gave

2760
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
And so, for the third trial, she gave

2761
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,270
And so, for the third trial, she gave Psyche an errand that should have ended

2762
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
Psyche an errand that should have ended

2763
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,950
Psyche an errand that should have ended her story for good. "Fetch me water,"

2764
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:32,960
her story for good. "Fetch me water,"

2765
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,750
her story for good. "Fetch me water," she said, not from a well, not from a

2766
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:35,760
she said, not from a well, not from a

2767
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,589
she said, not from a well, not from a stream, but from the river sticks

2768
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:37,599
stream, but from the river sticks

2769
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,270
stream, but from the river sticks itself.

2770
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:39,280
itself.

2771
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,190
itself. psyche pald. The sticks was no ordinary

2772
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,200
psyche pald. The sticks was no ordinary

2773
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,510
psyche pald. The sticks was no ordinary river. It marked the boundary between

2774
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,520
river. It marked the boundary between

2775
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,069
river. It marked the boundary between the world of the living and the dead.

2776
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:48,079
the world of the living and the dead.

2777
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,870
the world of the living and the dead. Its waters were sacred, cursed, and

2778
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:50,880
Its waters were sacred, cursed, and

2779
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,750
Its waters were sacred, cursed, and fatal to touch. Even the gods approached

2780
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:53,760
fatal to touch. Even the gods approached

2781
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,870
fatal to touch. Even the gods approached it with fear. Mortals didn't survive its

2782
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
it with fear. Mortals didn't survive its

2783
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,230
it with fear. Mortals didn't survive its banks. They didn't even return.

2784
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
banks. They didn't even return.

2785
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,829
banks. They didn't even return. Still, Psyche nodded. Her journey led

2786
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:03,839
Still, Psyche nodded. Her journey led

2787
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,470
Still, Psyche nodded. Her journey led her to the edge of a cliff so steep it

2788
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:06,480
her to the edge of a cliff so steep it

2789
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,510
her to the edge of a cliff so steep it seemed carved by the hands of titans.

2790
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,520
seemed carved by the hands of titans.

2791
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,309
seemed carved by the hands of titans. Far below the river sticks churned like

2792
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:12,319
Far below the river sticks churned like

2793
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,190
Far below the river sticks churned like black glass, and from it rose vaporous

2794
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,200
black glass, and from it rose vaporous

2795
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,950
black glass, and from it rose vaporous curses and the cries of lost souls.

2796
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960
curses and the cries of lost souls.

2797
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,589
curses and the cries of lost souls. Its current didn't flow. It coiled like

2798
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
Its current didn't flow. It coiled like

2799
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,950
Its current didn't flow. It coiled like a living serpent. Worse still, guarding

2800
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:24,960
a living serpent. Worse still, guarding

2801
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,510
a living serpent. Worse still, guarding the river were monstrous winged beings,

2802
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
the river were monstrous winged beings,

2803
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,750
the river were monstrous winged beings, centuries of the underworld. They

2804
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
centuries of the underworld. They

2805
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,510
centuries of the underworld. They swooped and screamed at anything that

2806
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,520
swooped and screamed at anything that

2807
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,990
swooped and screamed at anything that moved, claws sharp enough to tear bone

2808
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,000
moved, claws sharp enough to tear bone

2809
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,190
moved, claws sharp enough to tear bone from flesh. There was no way down, no

2810
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,200
from flesh. There was no way down, no

2811
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,870
from flesh. There was no way down, no path forward, no hope. She collapsed

2812
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:40,880
path forward, no hope. She collapsed

2813
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,870
path forward, no hope. She collapsed beneath a rock ledge, clutching the

2814
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:42,880
beneath a rock ledge, clutching the

2815
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,870
beneath a rock ledge, clutching the crystal vial Aphroditi had mockingly

2816
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:44,880
crystal vial Aphroditi had mockingly

2817
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,910
crystal vial Aphroditi had mockingly handed her. "Just a sip," the goddess

2818
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
handed her. "Just a sip," the goddess

2819
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,190
handed her. "Just a sip," the goddess had said. "Enough to show you tried."

2820
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,200
had said. "Enough to show you tried."

2821
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,030
had said. "Enough to show you tried." But then a shimmer. A high-pitched hum

2822
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:55,040
But then a shimmer. A high-pitched hum

2823
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,030
But then a shimmer. A high-pitched hum filled the air, and from a crack in the

2824
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:57,040
filled the air, and from a crack in the

2825
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,470
filled the air, and from a crack in the stone emerged a tiny creature. An eagle

2826
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,480
stone emerged a tiny creature. An eagle

2827
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,030
stone emerged a tiny creature. An eagle massive by bird standards, regal and

2828
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:03,040
massive by bird standards, regal and

2829
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,789
massive by bird standards, regal and goldeneyed,

2830
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:04,799
goldeneyed,

2831
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,190
goldeneyed, sent by Zeus himself, the eagle of

2832
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:07,200
sent by Zeus himself, the eagle of

2833
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,270
sent by Zeus himself, the eagle of thunder and kings.

2834
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:09,280
thunder and kings.

2835
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,510
thunder and kings. Without a word, it took the vial from

2836
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,520
Without a word, it took the vial from

2837
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,150
Without a word, it took the vial from Psyche's hand, spread its wings, and

2838
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:14,160
Psyche's hand, spread its wings, and

2839
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,710
Psyche's hand, spread its wings, and soared down the deadly cliff. The

2840
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:16,720
soared down the deadly cliff. The

2841
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,710
soared down the deadly cliff. The centuries shrieked, but dared not

2842
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:18,720
centuries shrieked, but dared not

2843
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,510
centuries shrieked, but dared not attack, for even death respected Zeus's

2844
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:21,520
attack, for even death respected Zeus's

2845
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,230
attack, for even death respected Zeus's command. Within moments, the eagle

2846
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240
command. Within moments, the eagle

2847
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,109
command. Within moments, the eagle returned, placing the sealed vial filled

2848
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:27,119
returned, placing the sealed vial filled

2849
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,510
returned, placing the sealed vial filled with Stixs's shimmering cursed waters

2850
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,520
with Stixs's shimmering cursed waters

2851
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,069
with Stixs's shimmering cursed waters into Psyche's trembling hands. She

2852
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:32,079
into Psyche's trembling hands. She

2853
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,549
into Psyche's trembling hands. She didn't ask why Zeus helped her. Perhaps

2854
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:34,559
didn't ask why Zeus helped her. Perhaps

2855
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,270
didn't ask why Zeus helped her. Perhaps Aos had once helped him. Perhaps even

2856
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:37,280
Aos had once helped him. Perhaps even

2857
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,069
Aos had once helped him. Perhaps even gods respected Love's endurance.

2858
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:40,079
gods respected Love's endurance.

2859
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,710
gods respected Love's endurance. When Psyche returned to Aphroditi, the

2860
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:42,720
When Psyche returned to Aphroditi, the

2861
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,789
When Psyche returned to Aphroditi, the goddess accepted the vial with stony

2862
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:44,799
goddess accepted the vial with stony

2863
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:49,349
goddess accepted the vial with stony silence. Psyche had passed again, but

2864
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:49,359
silence. Psyche had passed again, but

2865
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,750
silence. Psyche had passed again, but the final trial would take her where

2866
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:51,760
the final trial would take her where

2867
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,270
the final trial would take her where even gods fear to go. And not all love

2868
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:55,280
even gods fear to go. And not all love

2869
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,109
even gods fear to go. And not all love stories survive a journey into the

2870
01:02:57,109 --> 01:02:57,119
stories survive a journey into the

2871
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,150
stories survive a journey into the underworld. Aphrodites voice was colder

2872
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:00,160
underworld. Aphrodites voice was colder

2873
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,309
underworld. Aphrodites voice was colder than the sticks itself.

2874
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:02,319
than the sticks itself.

2875
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:05,349
than the sticks itself. For your final task, she said, you will

2876
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:05,359
For your final task, she said, you will

2877
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,630
For your final task, she said, you will journey to the realm of Hades. There you

2878
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:08,640
journey to the realm of Hades. There you

2879
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,870
journey to the realm of Hades. There you will beg Queen Pesphanany for a box of

2880
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:10,880
will beg Queen Pesphanany for a box of

2881
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,470
will beg Queen Pesphanany for a box of her beauty. A gift, you see, for me. I'm

2882
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:14,480
her beauty. A gift, you see, for me. I'm

2883
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,789
her beauty. A gift, you see, for me. I'm feeling quite worn lately. Your

2884
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:16,799
feeling quite worn lately. Your

2885
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,829
feeling quite worn lately. Your existence exhausts me. It was a death

2886
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:19,839
existence exhausts me. It was a death

2887
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,230
existence exhausts me. It was a death sentence. Even the boldest mortals

2888
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:22,240
sentence. Even the boldest mortals

2889
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,870
sentence. Even the boldest mortals avoided the underworld. The living did

2890
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:24,880
avoided the underworld. The living did

2891
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,510
avoided the underworld. The living did not enter Hades realm and return, but

2892
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:27,520
not enter Hades realm and return, but

2893
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,549
not enter Hades realm and return, but Psyche no longer hesitated. If the path

2894
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:30,559
Psyche no longer hesitated. If the path

2895
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,789
Psyche no longer hesitated. If the path to OS lay through darkness, then

2896
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:32,799
to OS lay through darkness, then

2897
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:35,430
to OS lay through darkness, then darkness would not stop her.

2898
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:35,440
darkness would not stop her.

2899
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,349
darkness would not stop her. Guided by whispers from sympathetic

2900
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:37,359
Guided by whispers from sympathetic

2901
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,910
Guided by whispers from sympathetic voices, some say demeter, others say

2902
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:39,920
voices, some say demeter, others say

2903
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,470
voices, some say demeter, others say invisible demons of kindness, she found

2904
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:42,480
invisible demons of kindness, she found

2905
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,190
invisible demons of kindness, she found a hidden entrance, a cave that pierced

2906
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
a hidden entrance, a cave that pierced

2907
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,950
a hidden entrance, a cave that pierced the world's surface like a forgotten

2908
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
the world's surface like a forgotten

2909
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,549
the world's surface like a forgotten scar.

2910
01:03:48,549 --> 01:03:48,559
scar.

2911
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,789
scar. She brought with her two coins for Karen

2912
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
She brought with her two coins for Karen

2913
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,029
She brought with her two coins for Karen the fairyman, and barley cakes for

2914
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:53,039
the fairyman, and barley cakes for

2915
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,710
the fairyman, and barley cakes for Cberus, the three-headed hound. Every

2916
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:56,720
Cberus, the three-headed hound. Every

2917
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,870
Cberus, the three-headed hound. Every step deeper drained the warmth from her

2918
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:58,880
step deeper drained the warmth from her

2919
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,309
step deeper drained the warmth from her bones. The air was thick, not with

2920
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:02,319
bones. The air was thick, not with

2921
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,870
bones. The air was thick, not with smoke, but silence.

2922
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:04,880
smoke, but silence.

2923
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,109
smoke, but silence. The souls she passed drifted like

2924
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
The souls she passed drifted like

2925
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,270
The souls she passed drifted like memories, thin, hollow, and unreachable.

2926
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:11,280
memories, thin, hollow, and unreachable.

2927
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,910
memories, thin, hollow, and unreachable. At the river Aaron, Karen accepted her

2928
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:13,920
At the river Aaron, Karen accepted her

2929
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,910
At the river Aaron, Karen accepted her payment and rode her through still

2930
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
payment and rode her through still

2931
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,029
payment and rode her through still waters stained with forgotten grief.

2932
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:19,039
waters stained with forgotten grief.

2933
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,589
waters stained with forgotten grief. When Cerberus appeared, snarling at the

2934
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
When Cerberus appeared, snarling at the

2935
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,990
When Cerberus appeared, snarling at the threshold of Pesphanie's palace, she fed

2936
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,000
threshold of Pesphanie's palace, she fed

2937
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,190
threshold of Pesphanie's palace, she fed him the cakes. He quieted, licking his

2938
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:27,200
him the cakes. He quieted, licking his

2939
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,430
him the cakes. He quieted, licking his bloodstained jaws.

2940
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
bloodstained jaws.

2941
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,910
bloodstained jaws. Inside, Pesphanie sat serene on her

2942
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
Inside, Pesphanie sat serene on her

2943
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,390
Inside, Pesphanie sat serene on her obsidian throne, eyes like polished

2944
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:34,400
obsidian throne, eyes like polished

2945
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,990
obsidian throne, eyes like polished garnets.

2946
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
garnets.

2947
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,470
garnets. "You come for beauty," the queen said,

2948
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,480
"You come for beauty," the queen said,

2949
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,150
"You come for beauty," the queen said, not unkindly. "But at what cost?" "I do

2950
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,160
not unkindly. "But at what cost?" "I do

2951
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,789
not unkindly. "But at what cost?" "I do not want it for myself," Psyche replied.

2952
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:44,799
not want it for myself," Psyche replied.

2953
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,910
not want it for myself," Psyche replied. "I must deliver it to Aphrodite."

2954
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:47,920
"I must deliver it to Aphrodite."

2955
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,630
"I must deliver it to Aphrodite." Pesphanie nodded. "Perhaps she too

2956
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:50,640
Pesphanie nodded. "Perhaps she too

2957
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,109
Pesphanie nodded. "Perhaps she too understood the madness of love." She

2958
01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:53,119
understood the madness of love." She

2959
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,150
understood the madness of love." She handed Psyche a small sealed box, plain,

2960
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:56,160
handed Psyche a small sealed box, plain,

2961
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,510
handed Psyche a small sealed box, plain, unmarked, and yet unbearably heavy. "Do

2962
01:04:59,510 --> 01:04:59,520
unmarked, and yet unbearably heavy. "Do

2963
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,309
unmarked, and yet unbearably heavy. "Do not open it," the queen warned. "It is

2964
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
not open it," the queen warned. "It is

2965
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,950
not open it," the queen warned. "It is not meant for your eyes." Psyche thanked

2966
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:04,960
not meant for your eyes." Psyche thanked

2967
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,510
not meant for your eyes." Psyche thanked her and turned to leave. The journey

2968
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:07,520
her and turned to leave. The journey

2969
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,670
her and turned to leave. The journey back was quiet, but heavier now with

2970
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:09,680
back was quiet, but heavier now with

2971
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,870
back was quiet, but heavier now with temptation. The box pulsed in her hands.

2972
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,880
temptation. The box pulsed in her hands.

2973
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,349
temptation. The box pulsed in her hands. "Surely just a peak couldn't hurt." She

2974
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:15,359
"Surely just a peak couldn't hurt." She

2975
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:18,710
"Surely just a peak couldn't hurt." She told herself no, over and over. But

2976
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:18,720
told herself no, over and over. But

2977
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,670
told herself no, over and over. But doubt, like before, crept in. What if

2978
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:21,680
doubt, like before, crept in. What if

2979
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,549
doubt, like before, crept in. What if this beauty made her worthy of OS again?

2980
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:24,559
this beauty made her worthy of OS again?

2981
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,589
this beauty made her worthy of OS again? What if this was the final key? The

2982
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:27,599
What if this was the final key? The

2983
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,789
What if this was the final key? The surface was near. Her heart raced, her

2984
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:30,799
surface was near. Her heart raced, her

2985
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,950
surface was near. Her heart raced, her fingers twitched, and as light returned

2986
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:32,960
fingers twitched, and as light returned

2987
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,829
fingers twitched, and as light returned to her face for the first time in days,

2988
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:35,839
to her face for the first time in days,

2989
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:38,309
to her face for the first time in days, she opened the box, and darkness

2990
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:38,319
she opened the box, and darkness

2991
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:41,029
she opened the box, and darkness consumed her. The moment Psyche opened

2992
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:41,039
consumed her. The moment Psyche opened

2993
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,910
consumed her. The moment Psyche opened the box, expecting light and beauty, a

2994
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:43,920
the box, expecting light and beauty, a

2995
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,230
the box, expecting light and beauty, a cold mist spilled from it like a breath

2996
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:46,240
cold mist spilled from it like a breath

2997
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,029
cold mist spilled from it like a breath from the grave. It wasn't beauty. It

2998
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:49,039
from the grave. It wasn't beauty. It

2999
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,069
from the grave. It wasn't beauty. It wasn't divine radiance. It was sleep.

3000
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:52,079
wasn't divine radiance. It was sleep.

3001
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,470
wasn't divine radiance. It was sleep. Not ordinary sleep, but the deathless

3002
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:54,480
Not ordinary sleep, but the deathless

3003
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,950
Not ordinary sleep, but the deathless slumber of the underworld crafted by

3004
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:56,960
slumber of the underworld crafted by

3005
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,510
slumber of the underworld crafted by Pesphanany to preserve her power, not to

3006
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
Pesphanany to preserve her power, not to

3007
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,829
Pesphanany to preserve her power, not to beautify Aphrodite.

3008
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:01,839
beautify Aphrodite.

3009
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,309
beautify Aphrodite. Psyche didn't scream. She didn't

3010
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:04,319
Psyche didn't scream. She didn't

3011
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,510
Psyche didn't scream. She didn't collapse. She simply dropped. Her body

3012
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:07,520
collapse. She simply dropped. Her body

3013
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,510
collapse. She simply dropped. Her body fell softly onto the grass at the edge

3014
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:09,520
fell softly onto the grass at the edge

3015
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,990
fell softly onto the grass at the edge of the mortal world. The sealed box

3016
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:12,000
of the mortal world. The sealed box

3017
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,109
of the mortal world. The sealed box beside her, her limbs frozen, her breath

3018
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:15,119
beside her, her limbs frozen, her breath

3019
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,870
beside her, her limbs frozen, her breath silenced. She wasn't dead, but neither

3020
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
silenced. She wasn't dead, but neither

3021
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,789
silenced. She wasn't dead, but neither was she alive.

3022
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:20,799
was she alive.

3023
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,750
was she alive. Caught in an eternal pause, her heart

3024
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:23,760
Caught in an eternal pause, her heart

3025
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,390
Caught in an eternal pause, her heart stilled by her own curiosity.

3026
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
stilled by her own curiosity.

3027
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,750
stilled by her own curiosity. And that might have been the end of

3028
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
And that might have been the end of

3029
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,870
And that might have been the end of psyche. But love has a way of surviving

3030
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:30,880
psyche. But love has a way of surviving

3031
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,510
psyche. But love has a way of surviving even death. Far away in Olympus, OS had

3032
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
even death. Far away in Olympus, OS had

3033
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,910
even death. Far away in Olympus, OS had not forgotten her. His wounds had

3034
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
not forgotten her. His wounds had

3035
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,270
not forgotten her. His wounds had healed, but his heart had not. He had

3036
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:41,280
healed, but his heart had not. He had

3037
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,430
healed, but his heart had not. He had kept away at his mother's command,

3038
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:43,440
kept away at his mother's command,

3039
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,829
kept away at his mother's command, tormented by visions of psyche toiling

3040
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
tormented by visions of psyche toiling

3041
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,630
tormented by visions of psyche toiling through impossible trials. And when he

3042
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:48,640
through impossible trials. And when he

3043
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,390
through impossible trials. And when he heard she had entered the underworld, he

3044
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:50,400
heard she had entered the underworld, he

3045
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,670
heard she had entered the underworld, he knew she had done it for him. Defying

3046
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:53,680
knew she had done it for him. Defying

3047
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:58,630
knew she had done it for him. Defying Aphroditi, braving death, all for love.

3048
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:58,640
Aphroditi, braving death, all for love.

3049
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,270
Aphroditi, braving death, all for love. That was no mortal girl. That was a

3050
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:01,280
That was no mortal girl. That was a

3051
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,950
That was no mortal girl. That was a queen.

3052
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:02,960
queen.

3053
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,349
queen. Os defied his mother, bursting from

3054
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:05,359
Os defied his mother, bursting from

3055
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,390
Os defied his mother, bursting from Olympus in a blaze of wings and gold. He

3056
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:08,400
Olympus in a blaze of wings and gold. He

3057
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,710
Olympus in a blaze of wings and gold. He raced through the skies, the clouds

3058
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:10,720
raced through the skies, the clouds

3059
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,710
raced through the skies, the clouds splitting at his heels, until he found

3060
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
splitting at his heels, until he found

3061
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,470
splitting at his heels, until he found her, motionless, silent, lying like a

3062
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:16,480
her, motionless, silent, lying like a

3063
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,270
her, motionless, silent, lying like a marble statue kissed by the dusk. He

3064
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:19,280
marble statue kissed by the dusk. He

3065
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,750
marble statue kissed by the dusk. He fell to his knees beside her, and he

3066
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:21,760
fell to his knees beside her, and he

3067
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,349
fell to his knees beside her, and he wept, not tears of sorrow, but of rage,

3068
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:25,359
wept, not tears of sorrow, but of rage,

3069
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:29,270
wept, not tears of sorrow, but of rage, of regret, of love too big for words. He

3070
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,280
of regret, of love too big for words. He

3071
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,029
of regret, of love too big for words. He lifted the box gently and sealed it

3072
01:07:31,029 --> 01:07:31,039
lifted the box gently and sealed it

3073
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,230
lifted the box gently and sealed it shut. Then, without hesitation, he

3074
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:34,240
shut. Then, without hesitation, he

3075
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,710
shut. Then, without hesitation, he leaned down and kissed her lips. Not a

3076
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,720
leaned down and kissed her lips. Not a

3077
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,470
leaned down and kissed her lips. Not a magical kiss, not a spell, just a kiss,

3078
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:40,480
magical kiss, not a spell, just a kiss,

3079
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,910
magical kiss, not a spell, just a kiss, a promise, a memory, a plea, and her

3080
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:43,920
a promise, a memory, a plea, and her

3081
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,430
a promise, a memory, a plea, and her eyes fluttered open. Psyche gasped, the

3082
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,440
eyes fluttered open. Psyche gasped, the

3083
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,750
eyes fluttered open. Psyche gasped, the sleep lifting like fog, her hands

3084
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:49,760
sleep lifting like fog, her hands

3085
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,430
sleep lifting like fog, her hands reached for him before she could even

3086
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:51,440
reached for him before she could even

3087
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,589
reached for him before she could even speak. Aeros, she breathed. You came

3088
01:07:55,589 --> 01:07:55,599
speak. Aeros, she breathed. You came

3089
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,470
speak. Aeros, she breathed. You came back, he whispered. I never stopped

3090
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,480
back, he whispered. I never stopped

3091
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,270
back, he whispered. I never stopped loving you. He held her tighter than

3092
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:01,280
loving you. He held her tighter than

3093
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,309
loving you. He held her tighter than ever before. And in that moment, all the

3094
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,319
ever before. And in that moment, all the

3095
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,950
ever before. And in that moment, all the gods who had watched, some amused, some

3096
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:06,960
gods who had watched, some amused, some

3097
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,390
gods who had watched, some amused, some angered, finally understood. Even the

3098
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:10,400
angered, finally understood. Even the

3099
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,670
angered, finally understood. Even the god of love, had met his match.

3100
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:13,680
god of love, had met his match.

3101
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,309
god of love, had met his match. Their reunion shook Olympus.

3102
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:16,319
Their reunion shook Olympus.

3103
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,470
Their reunion shook Olympus. OS, the god of love, had defied his

3104
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:18,480
OS, the god of love, had defied his

3105
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,590
OS, the god of love, had defied his mother. Psyche, a mortal, had defied

3106
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
mother. Psyche, a mortal, had defied

3107
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,309
mother. Psyche, a mortal, had defied death. And together, they had crossed

3108
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:24,319
death. And together, they had crossed

3109
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,709
death. And together, they had crossed the boundaries between divine and human,

3110
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:26,719
the boundaries between divine and human,

3111
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,070
the boundaries between divine and human, between duty and desire. Such love was

3112
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:30,080
between duty and desire. Such love was

3113
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,349
between duty and desire. Such love was dangerous. Aphrodite was livid. She

3114
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:33,359
dangerous. Aphrodite was livid. She

3115
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,349
dangerous. Aphrodite was livid. She stormed into the court of the gods,

3116
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:35,359
stormed into the court of the gods,

3117
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,510
stormed into the court of the gods, demanding punishment.

3118
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:37,520
demanding punishment.

3119
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,070
demanding punishment. This mortal, she cried, has mocked the

3120
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,080
This mortal, she cried, has mocked the

3121
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,470
This mortal, she cried, has mocked the gods, meddled with sacred laws, and

3122
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
gods, meddled with sacred laws, and

3123
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,669
gods, meddled with sacred laws, and corrupted my son. She must be erased.

3124
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:45,679
corrupted my son. She must be erased.

3125
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,070
corrupted my son. She must be erased. But the gods were no longer so certain.

3126
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:48,080
But the gods were no longer so certain.

3127
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,789
But the gods were no longer so certain. They had seen Psyche's trials, witnessed

3128
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:50,799
They had seen Psyche's trials, witnessed

3129
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,749
They had seen Psyche's trials, witnessed her suffer, persevere, and rise again.

3130
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:53,759
her suffer, persevere, and rise again.

3131
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,829
her suffer, persevere, and rise again. Her love had survived what no mortal

3132
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:55,839
Her love had survived what no mortal

3133
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,870
Her love had survived what no mortal love ever had. Still, the matter had to

3134
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:58,880
love ever had. Still, the matter had to

3135
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,550
love ever had. Still, the matter had to be decided. And so they turned to Zeus.

3136
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:02,560
be decided. And so they turned to Zeus.

3137
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,709
be decided. And so they turned to Zeus. The king of the gods sat silent on his

3138
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:04,719
The king of the gods sat silent on his

3139
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,510
The king of the gods sat silent on his throne, lightning in one hand, fate in

3140
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
throne, lightning in one hand, fate in

3141
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,149
throne, lightning in one hand, fate in the other. He had watched all of it,

3142
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:10,159
the other. He had watched all of it,

3143
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:12,950
the other. He had watched all of it, from psyches fall to her rise, from her

3144
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
from psyches fall to her rise, from her

3145
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,590
from psyches fall to her rise, from her doubt to her devotion.

3146
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
doubt to her devotion.

3147
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,910
doubt to her devotion. At last, he spoke. There is power, Zeus

3148
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:19,920
At last, he spoke. There is power, Zeus

3149
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,189
At last, he spoke. There is power, Zeus said, in a love that endures.

3150
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:23,199
said, in a love that endures.

3151
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,349
said, in a love that endures. Aphrodite opened her mouth to protest,

3152
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:25,359
Aphrodite opened her mouth to protest,

3153
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,070
Aphrodite opened her mouth to protest, but he raised a hand. You have tested

3154
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,080
but he raised a hand. You have tested

3155
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,110
but he raised a hand. You have tested her. She has passed more than any mortal

3156
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,120
her. She has passed more than any mortal

3157
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,749
her. She has passed more than any mortal I have ever seen. She is not unworthy of

3158
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:33,759
I have ever seen. She is not unworthy of

3159
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,390
I have ever seen. She is not unworthy of Olympus. She is proof that even mortals

3160
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:36,400
Olympus. She is proof that even mortals

3161
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,590
Olympus. She is proof that even mortals can love like gods. Then he turned to OS

3162
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:39,600
can love like gods. Then he turned to OS

3163
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,229
can love like gods. Then he turned to OS and Psyche. You want to be together

3164
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
and Psyche. You want to be together

3165
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:46,789
and Psyche. You want to be together truly forever? They both nodded. Then so

3166
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:46,799
truly forever? They both nodded. Then so

3167
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:50,070
truly forever? They both nodded. Then so be it. With a flick of his hand, Zeus

3168
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:50,080
be it. With a flick of his hand, Zeus

3169
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,470
be it. With a flick of his hand, Zeus summoned a goblet filled with ambrosia,

3170
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,480
summoned a goblet filled with ambrosia,

3171
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,189
summoned a goblet filled with ambrosia, the drink of the gods. He offered it to

3172
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:55,199
the drink of the gods. He offered it to

3173
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,550
the drink of the gods. He offered it to Psyche. Drink and you will no longer be

3174
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:58,560
Psyche. Drink and you will no longer be

3175
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,030
Psyche. Drink and you will no longer be mortal. Your heart will beat with

3176
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,040
mortal. Your heart will beat with

3177
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,390
mortal. Your heart will beat with eternity. Your soul will live among us.

3178
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:04,400
eternity. Your soul will live among us.

3179
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,189
eternity. Your soul will live among us. But your trials will not be erased. You

3180
01:10:07,189 --> 01:10:07,199
But your trials will not be erased. You

3181
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,590
But your trials will not be erased. You will carry them as we all carry the

3182
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:09,600
will carry them as we all carry the

3183
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,790
will carry them as we all carry the stories that shape us. Psyche took the

3184
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:12,800
stories that shape us. Psyche took the

3185
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,910
stories that shape us. Psyche took the goblet. Her hands didn't tremble. She

3186
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:15,920
goblet. Her hands didn't tremble. She

3187
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,870
goblet. Her hands didn't tremble. She drank. Warmth spread through her, not

3188
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880
drank. Warmth spread through her, not

3189
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,430
drank. Warmth spread through her, not burning, but blooming. Her senses

3190
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:21,440
burning, but blooming. Her senses

3191
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,709
burning, but blooming. Her senses expanded. Her heartbeat slowed, then

3192
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
expanded. Her heartbeat slowed, then

3193
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,110
expanded. Her heartbeat slowed, then deepened like a bell tolling across

3194
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
deepened like a bell tolling across

3195
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,470
deepened like a bell tolling across centuries. And just like that, she was

3196
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:30,480
centuries. And just like that, she was

3197
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,750
centuries. And just like that, she was divine. No longer mortal, no longer

3198
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:33,760
divine. No longer mortal, no longer

3199
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,590
divine. No longer mortal, no longer less.

3200
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:35,600
less.

3201
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,910
less. OS took her hand, and in front of all

3202
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:37,920
OS took her hand, and in front of all

3203
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,070
OS took her hand, and in front of all Olympus, they were declared husband and

3204
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,080
Olympus, they were declared husband and

3205
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,189
Olympus, they were declared husband and wife. Love, for once, had not ended in

3206
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:43,199
wife. Love, for once, had not ended in

3207
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,630
wife. Love, for once, had not ended in tragedy. It had been crowned.

3208
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:46,640
tragedy. It had been crowned.

3209
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,110
tragedy. It had been crowned. The moment Psyche drank the ambrosia,

3210
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,120
The moment Psyche drank the ambrosia,

3211
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,590
The moment Psyche drank the ambrosia, the transformation was complete. Not

3212
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:51,600
the transformation was complete. Not

3213
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,350
the transformation was complete. Not just in body, but in spirit. Her skin

3214
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:55,360
just in body, but in spirit. Her skin

3215
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,750
just in body, but in spirit. Her skin shimmerred with divine radiance. Her

3216
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:57,760
shimmerred with divine radiance. Her

3217
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,750
shimmerred with divine radiance. Her eyes now holding galaxies rather than

3218
01:10:59,750 --> 01:10:59,760
eyes now holding galaxies rather than

3219
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,590
eyes now holding galaxies rather than tears.

3220
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,600
tears.

3221
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,669
tears. The gods who once scoffed at her mortal

3222
01:11:03,669 --> 01:11:03,679
The gods who once scoffed at her mortal

3223
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,110
The gods who once scoffed at her mortal blood, now watched in awe.

3224
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:07,120
blood, now watched in awe.

3225
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,030
blood, now watched in awe. For the first time in Olympus's long

3226
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:09,040
For the first time in Olympus's long

3227
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,110
For the first time in Olympus's long memory, a mortal had earned her place

3228
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:11,120
memory, a mortal had earned her place

3229
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,070
memory, a mortal had earned her place among them, not by bloodline, but by

3230
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,080
among them, not by bloodline, but by

3231
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,669
among them, not by bloodline, but by devotion.

3232
01:11:15,669 --> 01:11:15,679
devotion.

3233
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:18,550
devotion. She was no longer Psyche the Girl or

3234
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:18,560
She was no longer Psyche the Girl or

3235
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,590
She was no longer Psyche the Girl or Psyche the Beautiful. She was now Psyche

3236
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:21,600
Psyche the Beautiful. She was now Psyche

3237
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,990
Psyche the Beautiful. She was now Psyche the Immortal, a goddess in her own

3238
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:24,000
the Immortal, a goddess in her own

3239
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,790
the Immortal, a goddess in her own right. Even Aphrodite, who had once

3240
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:26,800
right. Even Aphrodite, who had once

3241
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,950
right. Even Aphrodite, who had once cursed her, could no longer deny what

3242
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:28,960
cursed her, could no longer deny what

3243
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,669
cursed her, could no longer deny what stood before her. A woman who had faced

3244
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:31,679
stood before her. A woman who had faced

3245
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,630
stood before her. A woman who had faced death, temptation, betrayal, and

3246
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:34,640
death, temptation, betrayal, and

3247
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,430
death, temptation, betrayal, and isolation, and still chosen love over

3248
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:37,440
isolation, and still chosen love over

3249
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,870
isolation, and still chosen love over pride. Still, the goddess of love wasn't

3250
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:40,880
pride. Still, the goddess of love wasn't

3251
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,990
pride. Still, the goddess of love wasn't quick to forgive. But Aeros, ever his

3252
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:44,000
quick to forgive. But Aeros, ever his

3253
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,070
quick to forgive. But Aeros, ever his mother's son and yet fiercely Psyche's

3254
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,080
mother's son and yet fiercely Psyche's

3255
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,030
mother's son and yet fiercely Psyche's husband, stepped forward.

3256
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040
husband, stepped forward.

3257
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,870
husband, stepped forward. "She is no rival to your beauty,

3258
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
"She is no rival to your beauty,

3259
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,910
"She is no rival to your beauty, mother," he said gently. "She is

3260
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:53,920
mother," he said gently. "She is

3261
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,310
mother," he said gently. "She is something else entirely, the soul that

3262
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
something else entirely, the soul that

3263
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,270
something else entirely, the soul that understands love. And in that moment,

3264
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,280
understands love. And in that moment,

3265
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,229
understands love. And in that moment, the tension melted. Not completely, but

3266
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:02,239
the tension melted. Not completely, but

3267
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:05,270
the tension melted. Not completely, but enough." Aphrodites silence was her

3268
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:05,280
enough." Aphrodites silence was her

3269
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,750
enough." Aphrodites silence was her surrender. Zeus proclaimed her goddess

3270
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:07,760
surrender. Zeus proclaimed her goddess

3271
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,950
surrender. Zeus proclaimed her goddess of the soul. Psyche, whose very name in

3272
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:10,960
of the soul. Psyche, whose very name in

3273
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,030
of the soul. Psyche, whose very name in Greek meant both soul and breath of

3274
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,040
Greek meant both soul and breath of

3275
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,669
Greek meant both soul and breath of life. Her trials had shaped her not into

3276
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:15,679
life. Her trials had shaped her not into

3277
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,910
life. Her trials had shaped her not into a statue of perfection, but into the

3278
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
a statue of perfection, but into the

3279
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,870
a statue of perfection, but into the embodiment of what love endures.

3280
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:20,880
embodiment of what love endures.

3281
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,270
embodiment of what love endures. A great feast was held on Olympus.

3282
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
A great feast was held on Olympus.

3283
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,990
A great feast was held on Olympus. Nectar flowed like rivers. Stars danced

3284
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,000
Nectar flowed like rivers. Stars danced

3285
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,390
Nectar flowed like rivers. Stars danced in celebration, and even the fates

3286
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,400
in celebration, and even the fates

3287
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,390
in celebration, and even the fates smiled at the story they had once woven

3288
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:30,400
smiled at the story they had once woven

3289
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,910
smiled at the story they had once woven in whispers. Psyche stood by OS, no

3290
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:33,920
in whispers. Psyche stood by OS, no

3291
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,550
in whispers. Psyche stood by OS, no longer uncertain or afraid. She was

3292
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:36,560
longer uncertain or afraid. She was

3293
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,590
longer uncertain or afraid. She was equal. She was divine.

3294
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:39,600
equal. She was divine.

3295
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,830
equal. She was divine. Together they watched the skies above

3296
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:41,840
Together they watched the skies above

3297
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,630
Together they watched the skies above and the mortal world below. Guardians of

3298
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:44,640
and the mortal world below. Guardians of

3299
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,270
and the mortal world below. Guardians of love and the soul's journey. And from

3300
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:47,280
love and the soul's journey. And from

3301
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,070
love and the soul's journey. And from their union, a daughter was born.

3302
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:50,080
their union, a daughter was born.

3303
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,189
their union, a daughter was born. Hidone, goddess of pleasure and delight,

3304
01:12:53,189 --> 01:12:53,199
Hidone, goddess of pleasure and delight,

3305
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,350
Hidone, goddess of pleasure and delight, symbol of joy, born from the union of

3306
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
symbol of joy, born from the union of

3307
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,430
symbol of joy, born from the union of love and soul.

3308
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:57,440
love and soul.

3309
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,270
love and soul. Where once psyche had walked among

3310
01:12:59,270 --> 01:12:59,280
Where once psyche had walked among

3311
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,510
Where once psyche had walked among thorns and shadows, she now danced in

3312
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,520
thorns and shadows, she now danced in

3313
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,070
thorns and shadows, she now danced in eternal light. Not because she was

3314
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:04,080
eternal light. Not because she was

3315
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,870
eternal light. Not because she was perfect, but because she had loved,

3316
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:06,880
perfect, but because she had loved,

3317
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,189
perfect, but because she had loved, fallen, suffered, and risen again. She

3318
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:11,199
fallen, suffered, and risen again. She

3319
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,669
fallen, suffered, and risen again. She was proof that even mortals, even the

3320
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:13,679
was proof that even mortals, even the

3321
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,390
was proof that even mortals, even the brokenhearted, could reach the heavens,

3322
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:16,400
brokenhearted, could reach the heavens,

3323
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,310
brokenhearted, could reach the heavens, one trial at a time. And so, the tale of

3324
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:20,320
one trial at a time. And so, the tale of

3325
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,630
one trial at a time. And so, the tale of OS and Psyche, did not end in tragedy,

3326
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:22,640
OS and Psyche, did not end in tragedy,

3327
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,270
OS and Psyche, did not end in tragedy, as so many mortal loves do, but in

3328
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:25,280
as so many mortal loves do, but in

3329
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,310
as so many mortal loves do, but in transformation, not into myth, but into

3330
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,320
transformation, not into myth, but into

3331
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,709
transformation, not into myth, but into something far greater. A truth whispered

3332
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:30,719
something far greater. A truth whispered

3333
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,950
something far greater. A truth whispered across centuries from temples to

3334
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:32,960
across centuries from temples to

3335
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,149
across centuries from temples to bedrooms, from storytellers to dreamers.

3336
01:13:36,149 --> 01:13:36,159
bedrooms, from storytellers to dreamers.

3337
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,189
bedrooms, from storytellers to dreamers. Love, real love, is not easy. It is

3338
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:39,199
Love, real love, is not easy. It is

3339
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,870
Love, real love, is not easy. It is tested. It is doubted. It is wounded.

3340
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:42,880
tested. It is doubted. It is wounded.

3341
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,030
tested. It is doubted. It is wounded. But when it endures, it becomes eternal.

3342
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,040
But when it endures, it becomes eternal.

3343
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,510
But when it endures, it becomes eternal. Psyche's journey had begun with beauty,

3344
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:49,520
Psyche's journey had begun with beauty,

3345
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,550
Psyche's journey had begun with beauty, a curse she never asked for. She had

3346
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
a curse she never asked for. She had

3347
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,270
a curse she never asked for. She had been woripped by strangers, envied by

3348
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:55,280
been woripped by strangers, envied by

3349
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,390
been woripped by strangers, envied by sisters, manipulated by gods. She had

3350
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:58,400
sisters, manipulated by gods. She had

3351
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,470
sisters, manipulated by gods. She had been punished for being loved, then

3352
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,480
been punished for being loved, then

3353
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,350
been punished for being loved, then punished again for loving back. And yet

3354
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:03,360
punished again for loving back. And yet

3355
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,990
punished again for loving back. And yet she never stopped trying. Even when her

3356
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:06,000
she never stopped trying. Even when her

3357
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,229
she never stopped trying. Even when her heart broke, even when her faith

3358
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:08,239
heart broke, even when her faith

3359
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:11,590
heart broke, even when her faith cracked, she kept walking. And Aeros,

3360
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:11,600
cracked, she kept walking. And Aeros,

3361
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,350
cracked, she kept walking. And Aeros, the god of love, he learned too. That

3362
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:15,360
the god of love, he learned too. That

3363
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,870
the god of love, he learned too. That love is not a weapon, not a game, not a

3364
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
love is not a weapon, not a game, not a

3365
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,149
love is not a weapon, not a game, not a secret in the shadows. It is light, yes,

3366
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:22,159
secret in the shadows. It is light, yes,

3367
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,870
secret in the shadows. It is light, yes, but only if it is faced. Together they

3368
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:24,880
but only if it is faced. Together they

3369
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,870
but only if it is faced. Together they taught even Olympus a lesson it had long

3370
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:26,880
taught even Olympus a lesson it had long

3371
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,430
taught even Olympus a lesson it had long forgotten. Love does not belong solely

3372
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:29,440
forgotten. Love does not belong solely

3373
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,910
forgotten. Love does not belong solely to the gods. It belongs to anyone

3374
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:31,920
to the gods. It belongs to anyone

3375
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,229
to the gods. It belongs to anyone willing to fight for it. In temples

3376
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:34,239
willing to fight for it. In temples

3377
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:35,990
willing to fight for it. In temples across Greece, lovers would offer

3378
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
across Greece, lovers would offer

3379
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,310
across Greece, lovers would offer prayers not just to Aphroditi but to

3380
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,320
prayers not just to Aphroditi but to

3381
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,870
prayers not just to Aphroditi but to psyche. They would whisper her name

3382
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:40,880
psyche. They would whisper her name

3383
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,270
psyche. They would whisper her name before marriages, births, and even

3384
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:43,280
before marriages, births, and even

3385
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,830
before marriages, births, and even funerals. Because she wasn't just a

3386
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
funerals. Because she wasn't just a

3387
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,630
funerals. Because she wasn't just a goddess, she was a reminder that the

3388
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:48,640
goddess, she was a reminder that the

3389
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,189
goddess, she was a reminder that the soul can survive despair.

3390
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:51,199
soul can survive despair.

3391
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,950
soul can survive despair. That love when it falls can rise again.

3392
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:54,960
That love when it falls can rise again.

3393
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,550
That love when it falls can rise again. And that no matter how deep the

3394
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:56,560
And that no matter how deep the

3395
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,630
And that no matter how deep the underworld, no matter how sharp the

3396
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:58,640
underworld, no matter how sharp the

3397
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,229
underworld, no matter how sharp the trial, the heart knows the way back.

3398
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:02,239
trial, the heart knows the way back.

3399
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,630
trial, the heart knows the way back. Today, long after temples have crumbled

3400
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:04,640
Today, long after temples have crumbled

3401
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,270
Today, long after temples have crumbled and empires have fallen, the story still

3402
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:07,280
and empires have fallen, the story still

3403
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,350
and empires have fallen, the story still lives. In the word psyche, meaning soul.

3404
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:11,360
lives. In the word psyche, meaning soul.

3405
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,910
lives. In the word psyche, meaning soul. In the word psychology, the study of

3406
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:13,920
In the word psychology, the study of

3407
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,550
In the word psychology, the study of that soul. And in every tale where love

3408
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
that soul. And in every tale where love

3409
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,590
that soul. And in every tale where love is tested and triumphs,

3410
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:19,600
is tested and triumphs,

3411
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,390
is tested and triumphs, os and psyche live on, not as marble

3412
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:22,400
os and psyche live on, not as marble

3413
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,830
os and psyche live on, not as marble statues, but as echoes within all of us.

3414
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:25,840
statues, but as echoes within all of us.

3415
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,149
statues, but as echoes within all of us. Every time we choose trust over fear,

3416
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:28,159
Every time we choose trust over fear,

3417
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,709
Every time we choose trust over fear, forgiveness over pride, and love over

3418
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:30,719
forgiveness over pride, and love over

3419
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,149
forgiveness over pride, and love over silence, we walk their path. And

3420
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:34,159
silence, we walk their path. And

3421
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,709
silence, we walk their path. And perhaps, like them, we become a little

3422
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:36,719
perhaps, like them, we become a little

3423
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:41,270
perhaps, like them, we become a little more divine.

3424
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:43,520
Long before she was feared, before

3425
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,310
Long before she was feared, before statues froze midscream and serpents

3426
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:46,320
statues froze midscream and serpents

3427
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,110
statues froze midscream and serpents whispered across marble floors, Medusa

3428
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,120
whispered across marble floors, Medusa

3429
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,750
whispered across marble floors, Medusa was a mortal girl, beautiful beyond

3430
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:51,760
was a mortal girl, beautiful beyond

3431
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,470
was a mortal girl, beautiful beyond compare. Her beauty was not loud or

3432
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
compare. Her beauty was not loud or

3433
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,390
compare. Her beauty was not loud or proud. It simply existed, uninvited,

3434
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
proud. It simply existed, uninvited,

3435
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,430
proud. It simply existed, uninvited, like sunlight slipping through stone.

3436
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:01,440
like sunlight slipping through stone.

3437
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,270
like sunlight slipping through stone. Her hair shimmerred like strands of

3438
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:03,280
Her hair shimmerred like strands of

3439
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,229
Her hair shimmerred like strands of midnight silk. Her eyes held the calm of

3440
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:06,239
midnight silk. Her eyes held the calm of

3441
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,350
midnight silk. Her eyes held the calm of oceans before storms, and her presence,

3442
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:09,360
oceans before storms, and her presence,

3443
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,390
oceans before storms, and her presence, though quiet, unsettled kings and gods

3444
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:12,400
though quiet, unsettled kings and gods

3445
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,229
though quiet, unsettled kings and gods alike.

3446
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:14,239
alike.

3447
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:17,030
alike. She was born into a family of monsters,

3448
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
She was born into a family of monsters,

3449
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,189
She was born into a family of monsters, in a time where monsters were worshiped

3450
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:19,199
in a time where monsters were worshiped

3451
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,910
in a time where monsters were worshiped and feared in equal measure. Her

3452
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
and feared in equal measure. Her

3453
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,430
and feared in equal measure. Her sisters, Steno and Uriel, were immortal,

3454
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
sisters, Steno and Uriel, were immortal,

3455
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,390
sisters, Steno and Uriel, were immortal, fierce, and monstrous by design. But

3456
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:28,400
fierce, and monstrous by design. But

3457
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,030
fierce, and monstrous by design. But Medusa was different. She alone was

3458
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,040
Medusa was different. She alone was

3459
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,550
Medusa was different. She alone was mortal. She alone could die. And perhaps

3460
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:34,560
mortal. She alone could die. And perhaps

3461
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,110
mortal. She alone could die. And perhaps that made her even more precious. But

3462
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:37,120
that made her even more precious. But

3463
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,550
that made her even more precious. But Medusa wanted no throne, no lovers, no

3464
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:40,560
Medusa wanted no throne, no lovers, no

3465
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,510
Medusa wanted no throne, no lovers, no crown of divine favor. She chose

3466
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:43,520
crown of divine favor. She chose

3467
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,790
crown of divine favor. She chose something rarer, devotion.

3468
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:46,800
something rarer, devotion.

3469
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,790
something rarer, devotion. As a young woman, she entered the sacred

3470
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:48,800
As a young woman, she entered the sacred

3471
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,350
As a young woman, she entered the sacred service of Athena, the virgin goddess of

3472
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:51,360
service of Athena, the virgin goddess of

3473
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,630
service of Athena, the virgin goddess of wisdom, war, and restraint. In the

3474
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:54,640
wisdom, war, and restraint. In the

3475
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,709
wisdom, war, and restraint. In the echoing marble temple built high on

3476
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:56,719
echoing marble temple built high on

3477
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:59,350
echoing marble temple built high on cliffs above the sea, Medusa swept the

3478
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,360
cliffs above the sea, Medusa swept the

3479
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,910
cliffs above the sea, Medusa swept the floors, lit the incense, and whispered

3480
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:01,920
floors, lit the incense, and whispered

3481
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,030
floors, lit the incense, and whispered prayers long before dawn. She took the

3482
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
prayers long before dawn. She took the

3483
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,950
prayers long before dawn. She took the vows of chastity, purity, and silence.

3484
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:08,960
vows of chastity, purity, and silence.

3485
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,030
vows of chastity, purity, and silence. Not because she was forced to, but

3486
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,040
Not because she was forced to, but

3487
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,669
Not because she was forced to, but because she believed. She admired

3488
01:17:13,669 --> 01:17:13,679
because she believed. She admired

3489
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,630
because she believed. She admired Athena, not just as a goddess, but as an

3490
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:16,640
Athena, not just as a goddess, but as an

3491
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,750
Athena, not just as a goddess, but as an ideal, strong, untouchable, above the

3492
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,760
ideal, strong, untouchable, above the

3493
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,350
ideal, strong, untouchable, above the chaos of mortal hearts. In time, even

3494
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:23,360
chaos of mortal hearts. In time, even

3495
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,350
chaos of mortal hearts. In time, even the people began to whisper that Medusa

3496
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:25,360
the people began to whisper that Medusa

3497
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,550
the people began to whisper that Medusa was a living statue of Athena herself.

3498
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:28,560
was a living statue of Athena herself.

3499
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,470
was a living statue of Athena herself. Worshippers would sneak glances at her

3500
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:30,480
Worshippers would sneak glances at her

3501
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,110
Worshippers would sneak glances at her while pretending to pray. Her face

3502
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,120
while pretending to pray. Her face

3503
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,070
while pretending to pray. Her face became a symbol, her voice rarely heard,

3504
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:36,080
became a symbol, her voice rarely heard,

3505
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,189
became a symbol, her voice rarely heard, her life bound in sacred duty. But

3506
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
her life bound in sacred duty. But

3507
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,470
her life bound in sacred duty. But beauty, even in a temple, is not safe.

3508
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:42,480
beauty, even in a temple, is not safe.

3509
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,709
beauty, even in a temple, is not safe. Word of Medusa's grace spread beyond the

3510
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:44,719
Word of Medusa's grace spread beyond the

3511
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,510
Word of Medusa's grace spread beyond the temple walls, past the cities, through

3512
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
temple walls, past the cities, through

3513
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,470
temple walls, past the cities, through forests, into the realm of gods, and

3514
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,480
forests, into the realm of gods, and

3515
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,750
forests, into the realm of gods, and with it came danger. For in Olympus,

3516
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:53,760
with it came danger. For in Olympus,

3517
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,470
with it came danger. For in Olympus, desire often wore a divine face, and the

3518
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:56,480
desire often wore a divine face, and the

3519
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,229
desire often wore a divine face, and the line between admiration and possession

3520
01:17:58,229 --> 01:17:58,239
line between admiration and possession

3521
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,189
line between admiration and possession was razor thin. One god in particular

3522
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:01,199
was razor thin. One god in particular

3523
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:04,310
was razor thin. One god in particular took notice. Not a god of wisdom, not a

3524
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:04,320
took notice. Not a god of wisdom, not a

3525
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,110
took notice. Not a god of wisdom, not a god of restraint, but a god of seas,

3526
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,120
god of restraint, but a god of seas,

3527
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,149
god of restraint, but a god of seas, storms, and appetites. And while Medusa

3528
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:10,159
storms, and appetites. And while Medusa

3529
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:13,189
storms, and appetites. And while Medusa kept her vows, fate had already begun to

3530
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
kept her vows, fate had already begun to

3531
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,470
kept her vows, fate had already begun to twist. Because in the realm of gods,

3532
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:16,480
twist. Because in the realm of gods,

3533
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:20,390
twist. Because in the realm of gods, even purity can be punished. And soon,

3534
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,400
even purity can be punished. And soon,

3535
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,310
even purity can be punished. And soon, Medusa's sanctuary would become her

3536
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,320
Medusa's sanctuary would become her

3537
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,270
Medusa's sanctuary would become her prison. Far beneath the crashing waves

3538
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:25,280
prison. Far beneath the crashing waves

3539
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,550
prison. Far beneath the crashing waves and coral palaces of the deep, Poseidon

3540
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:28,560
and coral palaces of the deep, Poseidon

3541
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,669
and coral palaces of the deep, Poseidon ruled the seas with pride, fury, and a

3542
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:31,679
ruled the seas with pride, fury, and a

3543
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,550
ruled the seas with pride, fury, and a hunger that was never fully satisfied.

3544
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:34,560
hunger that was never fully satisfied.

3545
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,510
hunger that was never fully satisfied. He had tamed monsters, birthed storms,

3546
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:37,520
He had tamed monsters, birthed storms,

3547
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,550
He had tamed monsters, birthed storms, and claimed goddesses. But his eyes now

3548
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:40,560
and claimed goddesses. But his eyes now

3549
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,590
and claimed goddesses. But his eyes now turned to something far less divine. A

3550
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:43,600
turned to something far less divine. A

3551
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,390
turned to something far less divine. A mortal Medusa.

3552
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:46,400
mortal Medusa.

3553
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,229
mortal Medusa. Her beauty had reached even the ears of

3554
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:48,239
Her beauty had reached even the ears of

3555
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:51,189
Her beauty had reached even the ears of Olympus. But it was her stillness, her

3556
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:51,199
Olympus. But it was her stillness, her

3557
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,430
Olympus. But it was her stillness, her discipline, her untouchable grace that

3558
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:53,440
discipline, her untouchable grace that

3559
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,709
discipline, her untouchable grace that obsessed him. She belonged to no man, no

3560
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
obsessed him. She belonged to no man, no

3561
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,910
obsessed him. She belonged to no man, no god, no mortal king. She had chosen a

3562
01:18:59,910 --> 01:18:59,920
god, no mortal king. She had chosen a

3563
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,310
god, no mortal king. She had chosen a life of devotion, one that placed her

3564
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:02,320
life of devotion, one that placed her

3565
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,630
life of devotion, one that placed her far from desire. And perhaps that was

3566
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:04,640
far from desire. And perhaps that was

3567
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,510
far from desire. And perhaps that was what tempted Poseidon most. The more she

3568
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
what tempted Poseidon most. The more she

3569
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,390
what tempted Poseidon most. The more she prayed, the more he watched. And one

3570
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:10,400
prayed, the more he watched. And one

3571
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,310
prayed, the more he watched. And one evening, when the tide was high and the

3572
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:12,320
evening, when the tide was high and the

3573
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,870
evening, when the tide was high and the temple was empty, Poseidon rose from the

3574
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:14,880
temple was empty, Poseidon rose from the

3575
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,630
temple was empty, Poseidon rose from the sea. He did not knock. Gods rarely ask

3576
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:18,640
sea. He did not knock. Gods rarely ask

3577
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,189
sea. He did not knock. Gods rarely ask permission. He entered Athena's sacred

3578
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:21,199
permission. He entered Athena's sacred

3579
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,750
permission. He entered Athena's sacred temple as water pulled beneath his feet.

3580
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:23,760
temple as water pulled beneath his feet.

3581
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,830
temple as water pulled beneath his feet. A trail of seaater soaking the marble

3582
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:25,840
A trail of seaater soaking the marble

3583
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,750
A trail of seaater soaking the marble floor. Medusa, alone and unsuspecting,

3584
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:29,760
floor. Medusa, alone and unsuspecting,

3585
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,709
floor. Medusa, alone and unsuspecting, turned only to find the sea god looming

3586
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:32,719
turned only to find the sea god looming

3587
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:35,590
turned only to find the sea god looming in the shadows, his trident left behind,

3588
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:35,600
in the shadows, his trident left behind,

3589
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,870
in the shadows, his trident left behind, but his hunger very much present.

3590
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:38,880
but his hunger very much present.

3591
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,270
but his hunger very much present. She called out to Athena, but her cries

3592
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:41,280
She called out to Athena, but her cries

3593
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:45,350
She called out to Athena, but her cries echoed unanswered. She ran, but temples

3594
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,360
echoed unanswered. She ran, but temples

3595
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,590
echoed unanswered. She ran, but temples built for worship were not made for

3596
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:47,600
built for worship were not made for

3597
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,390
built for worship were not made for escape. And there, beneath the cold

3598
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
escape. And there, beneath the cold

3599
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,270
escape. And there, beneath the cold stone gaze of Athena's statue, Poseidon

3600
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280
stone gaze of Athena's statue, Poseidon

3601
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,750
stone gaze of Athena's statue, Poseidon defiled what was sacred. It was not a

3602
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:55,760
defiled what was sacred. It was not a

3603
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,270
defiled what was sacred. It was not a seduction. It was a violation. When it

3604
01:19:59,270 --> 01:19:59,280
seduction. It was a violation. When it

3605
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,910
seduction. It was a violation. When it was over, Poseidon vanished, leaving

3606
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:01,920
was over, Poseidon vanished, leaving

3607
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,030
was over, Poseidon vanished, leaving nothing but salt and silence behind.

3608
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
nothing but salt and silence behind.

3609
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,229
nothing but salt and silence behind. Medusa, broken, curled beneath her

3610
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:08,239
Medusa, broken, curled beneath her

3611
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,630
Medusa, broken, curled beneath her goddess's image, waiting for justice,

3612
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:10,640
goddess's image, waiting for justice,

3613
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,830
goddess's image, waiting for justice, for comfort, for anything divine. But

3614
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:13,840
for comfort, for anything divine. But

3615
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,550
for comfort, for anything divine. But gods are not always just. When Athena

3616
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:16,560
gods are not always just. When Athena

3617
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,310
gods are not always just. When Athena returned to her temple and saw the

3618
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:18,320
returned to her temple and saw the

3619
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,590
returned to her temple and saw the desecration, her fury was absolute. But

3620
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:21,600
desecration, her fury was absolute. But

3621
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,870
desecration, her fury was absolute. But not at Poseidon, at Medusa.

3622
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:24,880
not at Poseidon, at Medusa.

3623
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,830
not at Poseidon, at Medusa. Whether out of pride, denial, or divine

3624
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:27,840
Whether out of pride, denial, or divine

3625
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,310
Whether out of pride, denial, or divine law, Athena blamed her priestess for

3626
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320
law, Athena blamed her priestess for

3627
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,709
law, Athena blamed her priestess for allowing the temple to be defiled,

3628
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:32,719
allowing the temple to be defiled,

3629
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:34,950
allowing the temple to be defiled, whether she saw Medusa as complicit or

3630
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:34,960
whether she saw Medusa as complicit or

3631
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,990
whether she saw Medusa as complicit or simply inconvenient didn't matter. The

3632
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
simply inconvenient didn't matter. The

3633
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,790
simply inconvenient didn't matter. The purity of her sanctuary had been broken.

3634
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:40,800
purity of her sanctuary had been broken.

3635
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,189
purity of her sanctuary had been broken. And so the goddess of wisdom passed

3636
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:43,199
And so the goddess of wisdom passed

3637
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,510
And so the goddess of wisdom passed judgment not on the god who had

3638
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:45,520
judgment not on the god who had

3639
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,310
judgment not on the god who had violated, but on the mortal who had been

3640
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
violated, but on the mortal who had been

3641
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,590
violated, but on the mortal who had been violated. Because even in myth, power

3642
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:51,600
violated. Because even in myth, power

3643
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,110
violated. Because even in myth, power protects itself. and Medusa, once a

3644
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:55,120
protects itself. and Medusa, once a

3645
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,510
protects itself. and Medusa, once a symbol of sacred beauty, would now be

3646
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:57,520
symbol of sacred beauty, would now be

3647
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,830
symbol of sacred beauty, would now be transformed into a warning no one could

3648
01:20:59,830 --> 01:20:59,840
transformed into a warning no one could

3649
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,430
transformed into a warning no one could ignore.

3650
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:01,440
ignore.

3651
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,510
ignore. The temple floor was still stained with

3652
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:03,520
The temple floor was still stained with

3653
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,149
The temple floor was still stained with seaater when Athena returned. The

3654
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:06,159
seaater when Athena returned. The

3655
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,870
seaater when Athena returned. The incense had long burned out. The silence

3656
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
incense had long burned out. The silence

3657
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,830
incense had long burned out. The silence was heavy, and at its center, Medusa

3658
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:11,840
was heavy, and at its center, Medusa

3659
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,390
was heavy, and at its center, Medusa knelt in shame, her head bowed beneath

3660
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,400
knelt in shame, her head bowed beneath

3661
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,270
knelt in shame, her head bowed beneath the unblinking gaze of her goddess. But

3662
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:17,280
the unblinking gaze of her goddess. But

3663
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,070
the unblinking gaze of her goddess. But Athena's eyes were not filled with pity.

3664
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,080
Athena's eyes were not filled with pity.

3665
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,430
Athena's eyes were not filled with pity. They burned with fury. For her temple,

3666
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,440
They burned with fury. For her temple,

3667
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,070
They burned with fury. For her temple, her sanctuary of reason, discipline, and

3668
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
her sanctuary of reason, discipline, and

3669
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,590
her sanctuary of reason, discipline, and virgin purity had been defiled. And

3670
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:29,600
virgin purity had been defiled. And

3671
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,590
virgin purity had been defiled. And though Poseidon had violated sacred

3672
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:31,600
though Poseidon had violated sacred

3673
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,750
though Poseidon had violated sacred ground, it was Medusa who bore the

3674
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:33,760
ground, it was Medusa who bore the

3675
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,470
ground, it was Medusa who bore the blame. To Athena, there could be no

3676
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:36,480
blame. To Athena, there could be no

3677
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,669
blame. To Athena, there could be no forgiveness. Gods never apologized, and

3678
01:21:39,669 --> 01:21:39,679
forgiveness. Gods never apologized, and

3679
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:42,229
forgiveness. Gods never apologized, and temples never forgot. The punishment had

3680
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,239
temples never forgot. The punishment had

3681
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,070
temples never forgot. The punishment had to be symbolic,

3682
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,080
to be symbolic,

3683
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,470
to be symbolic, eternal. She stepped down from her

3684
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:46,480
eternal. She stepped down from her

3685
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,350
eternal. She stepped down from her statue's pedestal and stood over Medusa,

3686
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:49,360
statue's pedestal and stood over Medusa,

3687
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,310
statue's pedestal and stood over Medusa, who trembled, confused, awaiting mercy

3688
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:52,320
who trembled, confused, awaiting mercy

3689
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,990
who trembled, confused, awaiting mercy from the very goddess she had worshiped

3690
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
from the very goddess she had worshiped

3691
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,350
from the very goddess she had worshiped for years. But mercy was not given.

3692
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,360
for years. But mercy was not given.

3693
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,910
for years. But mercy was not given. Instead, Athena's voice echoed like

3694
01:21:59,910 --> 01:21:59,920
Instead, Athena's voice echoed like

3695
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,110
Instead, Athena's voice echoed like thunder between marble walls. "You have

3696
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:03,120
thunder between marble walls. "You have

3697
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,990
thunder between marble walls. "You have brought shame into my house. Let the

3698
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:06,000
brought shame into my house. Let the

3699
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,830
brought shame into my house. Let the world see what becomes of beauty that

3700
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
world see what becomes of beauty that

3701
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,149
world see what becomes of beauty that invites destruction."

3702
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:10,159
invites destruction."

3703
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,310
invites destruction." With a single gesture, she reached down

3704
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:12,320
With a single gesture, she reached down

3705
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,870
With a single gesture, she reached down and touched Medusa's forehead.

3706
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:14,880
and touched Medusa's forehead.

3707
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,750
and touched Medusa's forehead. The transformation was immediate. Golden

3708
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:17,760
The transformation was immediate. Golden

3709
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,470
The transformation was immediate. Golden hair turned to writhing serpents. Their

3710
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:20,480
hair turned to writhing serpents. Their

3711
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,550
hair turned to writhing serpents. Their hissing a cruel mimicry of whispered

3712
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,560
hissing a cruel mimicry of whispered

3713
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,750
hissing a cruel mimicry of whispered prayers. Her skin lost its warmth. Her

3714
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:25,760
prayers. Her skin lost its warmth. Her

3715
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:29,189
prayers. Her skin lost its warmth. Her gaze became a weapon. Her eyes once soft

3716
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:29,199
gaze became a weapon. Her eyes once soft

3717
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,629
gaze became a weapon. Her eyes once soft with sorrow now held a terrible power.

3718
01:22:32,629 --> 01:22:32,639
with sorrow now held a terrible power.

3719
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,229
with sorrow now held a terrible power. Anyone who looked into them would turn

3720
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:34,239
Anyone who looked into them would turn

3721
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:37,590
Anyone who looked into them would turn to stone. Not enemies, not invaders,

3722
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:37,600
to stone. Not enemies, not invaders,

3723
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,750
to stone. Not enemies, not invaders, anyone. It was not a punishment of

3724
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:39,760
anyone. It was not a punishment of

3725
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,110
anyone. It was not a punishment of protection. It was isolation. A curse

3726
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:43,120
protection. It was isolation. A curse

3727
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,550
protection. It was isolation. A curse disguised as defense. Medusa cried out,

3728
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:46,560
disguised as defense. Medusa cried out,

3729
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,510
disguised as defense. Medusa cried out, her voice no longer human. Her tears

3730
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:49,520
her voice no longer human. Her tears

3731
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,990
her voice no longer human. Her tears once salt water now dried before

3732
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,000
once salt water now dried before

3733
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,750
once salt water now dried before falling.

3734
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:53,760
falling.

3735
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,629
falling. Her breath became still. Her reflection

3736
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:56,639
Her breath became still. Her reflection

3737
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:00,149
Her breath became still. Her reflection shattered mirrors. And worst of all, she

3738
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:00,159
shattered mirrors. And worst of all, she

3739
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:01,830
shattered mirrors. And worst of all, she could no longer look at another soul

3740
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:01,840
could no longer look at another soul

3741
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,550
could no longer look at another soul without destroying it. Athena did not

3742
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
without destroying it. Athena did not

3743
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,990
without destroying it. Athena did not weep. She did not turn away. She simply

3744
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,000
weep. She did not turn away. She simply

3745
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,709
weep. She did not turn away. She simply watched as her priestess, once beautiful

3746
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:10,719
watched as her priestess, once beautiful

3747
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,430
watched as her priestess, once beautiful and devout, became something else

3748
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:13,440
and devout, became something else

3749
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,189
and devout, became something else entirely,

3750
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:15,199
entirely,

3751
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,270
entirely, a monster.

3752
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:17,280
a monster.

3753
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,910
a monster. The temple doors closed behind Medusa as

3754
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:19,920
The temple doors closed behind Medusa as

3755
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,550
The temple doors closed behind Medusa as she fled into exile, her cries echoing

3756
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:22,560
she fled into exile, her cries echoing

3757
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,470
she fled into exile, her cries echoing through the hills. No home, no temple,

3758
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:26,480
through the hills. No home, no temple,

3759
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,830
through the hills. No home, no temple, no sisters, no prayers, just stone

3760
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:29,840
no sisters, no prayers, just stone

3761
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,470
no sisters, no prayers, just stone trails in her wake. And from the cliffs

3762
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:32,480
trails in her wake. And from the cliffs

3763
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,870
trails in her wake. And from the cliffs of Olympus, Athena returned to her

3764
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:34,880
of Olympus, Athena returned to her

3765
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,430
of Olympus, Athena returned to her throne unmoved.

3766
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:37,440
throne unmoved.

3767
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,910
throne unmoved. For in the eyes of the gods, punishment

3768
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:39,920
For in the eyes of the gods, punishment

3769
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,030
For in the eyes of the gods, punishment need not be fair, only lasting, and

3770
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:43,040
need not be fair, only lasting, and

3771
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,870
need not be fair, only lasting, and Medusa's face would last longer than

3772
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880
Medusa's face would last longer than

3773
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,149
Medusa's face would last longer than memory. Banished from temple and city,

3774
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:48,159
memory. Banished from temple and city,

3775
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,390
memory. Banished from temple and city, Medusa wandered into the wilderness,

3776
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:50,400
Medusa wandered into the wilderness,

3777
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,310
Medusa wandered into the wilderness, alone, cursed, and feared. Her steps

3778
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:54,320
alone, cursed, and feared. Her steps

3779
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,030
alone, cursed, and feared. Her steps carved a trail of stone across the land.

3780
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,040
carved a trail of stone across the land.

3781
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,030
carved a trail of stone across the land. Each accidental glance at a passing

3782
01:23:59,030 --> 01:23:59,040
Each accidental glance at a passing

3783
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,550
Each accidental glance at a passing creature turning it to lifeless marble.

3784
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:02,560
creature turning it to lifeless marble.

3785
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,430
creature turning it to lifeless marble. Birds mid-flight, deer in the brush,

3786
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:05,440
Birds mid-flight, deer in the brush,

3787
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,550
Birds mid-flight, deer in the brush, even insects that dared meet her gaze,

3788
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:08,560
even insects that dared meet her gaze,

3789
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,590
even insects that dared meet her gaze, frozen forever in silence, she sought

3790
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:11,600
frozen forever in silence, she sought

3791
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,070
frozen forever in silence, she sought refuge where no man would follow, in the

3792
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:14,080
refuge where no man would follow, in the

3793
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,629
refuge where no man would follow, in the distant lands beyond rivers and ruin to

3794
01:24:16,629 --> 01:24:16,639
distant lands beyond rivers and ruin to

3795
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,790
distant lands beyond rivers and ruin to a bleak windswept island at the edge of

3796
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:18,800
a bleak windswept island at the edge of

3797
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,910
a bleak windswept island at the edge of the world, a place untouched by gods or

3798
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:21,920
the world, a place untouched by gods or

3799
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,669
the world, a place untouched by gods or mortals.

3800
01:24:23,669 --> 01:24:23,679
mortals.

3801
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:26,950
mortals. There she built no shelter. What use was

3802
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:26,960
There she built no shelter. What use was

3803
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,629
There she built no shelter. What use was a roof when the stars offered no

3804
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
a roof when the stars offered no

3805
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,270
a roof when the stars offered no comfort? What use were walls when her

3806
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
comfort? What use were walls when her

3807
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,149
comfort? What use were walls when her enemies had once been her protectors?

3808
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:34,159
enemies had once been her protectors?

3809
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:36,070
enemies had once been her protectors? The cave she entered was already half

3810
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:36,080
The cave she entered was already half

3811
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,470
The cave she entered was already half filled with statues, longforgotten

3812
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,480
filled with statues, longforgotten

3813
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,430
filled with statues, longforgotten warriors, beasts, or perhaps even fellow

3814
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:41,440
warriors, beasts, or perhaps even fellow

3815
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,350
warriors, beasts, or perhaps even fellow wanderers who met her eyes for a moment

3816
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:43,360
wanderers who met her eyes for a moment

3817
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:47,189
wanderers who met her eyes for a moment too long. And so began her second life,

3818
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:47,199
too long. And so began her second life,

3819
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:51,189
too long. And so began her second life, not as a priestess, but as a pariah.

3820
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:51,199
not as a priestess, but as a pariah.

3821
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:54,229
not as a priestess, but as a pariah. Medusa no longer wept. Tears belonged to

3822
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:54,239
Medusa no longer wept. Tears belonged to

3823
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:57,110
Medusa no longer wept. Tears belonged to the girl she once was. The girl who

3824
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:57,120
the girl she once was. The girl who

3825
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,590
the girl she once was. The girl who believed in justice, who offered incense

3826
01:24:59,590 --> 01:24:59,600
believed in justice, who offered incense

3827
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,669
believed in justice, who offered incense to Athena, who thought love could be

3828
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:01,679
to Athena, who thought love could be

3829
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,910
to Athena, who thought love could be earned through loyalty.

3830
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:03,920
earned through loyalty.

3831
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,709
earned through loyalty. That girl had died on the temple floor.

3832
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:06,719
That girl had died on the temple floor.

3833
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,510
That girl had died on the temple floor. In her place stood something else, not a

3834
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:09,520
In her place stood something else, not a

3835
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,110
In her place stood something else, not a monster, but a woman shaped by betrayal.

3836
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:13,120
monster, but a woman shaped by betrayal.

3837
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,990
monster, but a woman shaped by betrayal. Her serpents whispered to her in dreams,

3838
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:16,000
Her serpents whispered to her in dreams,

3839
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,270
Her serpents whispered to her in dreams, not in words, but in instincts, warnings

3840
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:19,280
not in words, but in instincts, warnings

3841
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,590
not in words, but in instincts, warnings of intruders, echoes of approaching

3842
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:21,600
of intruders, echoes of approaching

3843
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,910
of intruders, echoes of approaching footsteps. Her hair had become her

3844
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:23,920
footsteps. Her hair had become her

3845
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,750
footsteps. Her hair had become her guardians. Her eyes, her curse, her

3846
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:27,760
guardians. Her eyes, her curse, her

3847
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,950
guardians. Her eyes, her curse, her soul, a flickering memory. She began

3848
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:30,960
soul, a flickering memory. She began

3849
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,790
soul, a flickering memory. She began carving the walls of her cave with

3850
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:32,800
carving the walls of her cave with

3851
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,470
carving the walls of her cave with images, faces, hands, the temple she

3852
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:36,480
images, faces, hands, the temple she

3853
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:39,830
images, faces, hands, the temple she once served. Even her sisters, her

3854
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:39,840
once served. Even her sisters, her

3855
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,310
once served. Even her sisters, her memories were fading, and stone was all

3856
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:42,320
memories were fading, and stone was all

3857
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,830
memories were fading, and stone was all she had left. Occasionally, heroes would

3858
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:45,840
she had left. Occasionally, heroes would

3859
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,629
she had left. Occasionally, heroes would come, lured by stories of a cursed

3860
01:25:48,629 --> 01:25:48,639
come, lured by stories of a cursed

3861
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,709
come, lured by stories of a cursed maiden or tempted by the challenge of

3862
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:50,719
maiden or tempted by the challenge of

3863
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:53,430
maiden or tempted by the challenge of slaying a beast. They believed she was

3864
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:53,440
slaying a beast. They believed she was

3865
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,149
slaying a beast. They believed she was evil, that by killing her they might

3866
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:56,159
evil, that by killing her they might

3867
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,470
evil, that by killing her they might rise in glory. But none of them

3868
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:58,480
rise in glory. But none of them

3869
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,750
rise in glory. But none of them returned. They underestimated her. Not

3870
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:01,760
returned. They underestimated her. Not

3871
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,669
returned. They underestimated her. Not just her power, but her pain. And yet,

3872
01:26:05,669 --> 01:26:05,679
just her power, but her pain. And yet,

3873
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:08,550
just her power, but her pain. And yet, with each death, Medusa felt less like a

3874
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:08,560
with each death, Medusa felt less like a

3875
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,950
with each death, Medusa felt less like a victim and more like the very monster

3876
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:10,960
victim and more like the very monster

3877
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,990
victim and more like the very monster the world imagined. Her humanity had not

3878
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:14,000
the world imagined. Her humanity had not

3879
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,629
the world imagined. Her humanity had not died, but it was fading. And the gods,

3880
01:26:18,629 --> 01:26:18,639
died, but it was fading. And the gods,

3881
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,189
died, but it was fading. And the gods, they had already looked away. Far from

3882
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:21,199
they had already looked away. Far from

3883
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,709
they had already looked away. Far from Medusa's cave, in the bustling

3884
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:22,719
Medusa's cave, in the bustling

3885
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,270
Medusa's cave, in the bustling citystates and sacred temples of Greece,

3886
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:25,280
citystates and sacred temples of Greece,

3887
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,830
citystates and sacred temples of Greece, her name began to change. No longer

3888
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
her name began to change. No longer

3889
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,990
her name began to change. No longer spoken in mourning, it passed from mouth

3890
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:30,000
spoken in mourning, it passed from mouth

3891
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,310
spoken in mourning, it passed from mouth to mouth like a warning, distorted,

3892
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,320
to mouth like a warning, distorted,

3893
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,189
to mouth like a warning, distorted, retold, and reshaped.

3894
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
retold, and reshaped.

3895
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:39,189
retold, and reshaped. Medusa, the Gorgon. Medusa, the cursed

3896
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:39,199
Medusa, the Gorgon. Medusa, the cursed

3897
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:42,470
Medusa, the Gorgon. Medusa, the cursed temptress. Medusa, whose gaze turns men

3898
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,480
temptress. Medusa, whose gaze turns men

3899
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,750
temptress. Medusa, whose gaze turns men to stone. Her past as a devoted

3900
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:45,760
to stone. Her past as a devoted

3901
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,070
to stone. Her past as a devoted priestess, a mortal girl who served the

3902
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:48,080
priestess, a mortal girl who served the

3903
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,350
priestess, a mortal girl who served the gods, was buried beneath myth. In its

3904
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:51,360
gods, was buried beneath myth. In its

3905
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,910
gods, was buried beneath myth. In its place rose a monster's tale, a creature

3906
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:53,920
place rose a monster's tale, a creature

3907
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,229
place rose a monster's tale, a creature with serpent hair whose eyes held the

3908
01:26:56,229 --> 01:26:56,239
with serpent hair whose eyes held the

3909
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:58,629
with serpent hair whose eyes held the wrath of the underworld. They didn't

3910
01:26:58,629 --> 01:26:58,639
wrath of the underworld. They didn't

3911
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,110
wrath of the underworld. They didn't tell of Poseidon's violation. They

3912
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:01,120
tell of Poseidon's violation. They

3913
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,550
tell of Poseidon's violation. They didn't mention Athena's cruel

3914
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:02,560
didn't mention Athena's cruel

3915
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,270
didn't mention Athena's cruel punishment. The gods roles were edited

3916
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:05,280
punishment. The gods roles were edited

3917
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,750
punishment. The gods roles were edited out, smoothed over by priests and poets

3918
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:07,760
out, smoothed over by priests and poets

3919
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,830
out, smoothed over by priests and poets who preferred their gods spotless and

3920
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:09,840
who preferred their gods spotless and

3921
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,550
who preferred their gods spotless and their monsters clearly marked. Children

3922
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:12,560
their monsters clearly marked. Children

3923
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,629
their monsters clearly marked. Children were warned to obey their parents or

3924
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:14,639
were warned to obey their parents or

3925
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,189
were warned to obey their parents or Medusa would come in the night. Soldiers

3926
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:17,199
Medusa would come in the night. Soldiers

3927
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,430
Medusa would come in the night. Soldiers carved her image onto shields, not to

3928
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:19,440
carved her image onto shields, not to

3929
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,149
carved her image onto shields, not to honor her, but to mock her. Her face

3930
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:22,159
honor her, but to mock her. Her face

3931
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,870
honor her, but to mock her. Her face became a symbol of fear, a cautionary

3932
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:24,880
became a symbol of fear, a cautionary

3933
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:28,870
became a symbol of fear, a cautionary tale, and yet her image spread. Artists

3934
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:28,880
tale, and yet her image spread. Artists

3935
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,189
tale, and yet her image spread. Artists painted her on pottery. Her twisted

3936
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
painted her on pottery. Her twisted

3937
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,910
painted her on pottery. Her twisted silhouette danced across mosaics. Her

3938
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:33,920
silhouette danced across mosaics. Her

3939
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,910
silhouette danced across mosaics. Her snarling face was carved into temple

3940
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:35,920
snarling face was carved into temple

3941
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,189
snarling face was carved into temple walls, not in reverence, but as a weapon

3942
01:27:39,189 --> 01:27:39,199
walls, not in reverence, but as a weapon

3943
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,350
walls, not in reverence, but as a weapon used by the very gods who had cast her

3944
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:41,360
used by the very gods who had cast her

3945
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:45,189
used by the very gods who had cast her out. Medusa from exile could only feel

3946
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:45,199
out. Medusa from exile could only feel

3947
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,590
out. Medusa from exile could only feel the weight of their words. She didn't

3948
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600
the weight of their words. She didn't

3949
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,149
the weight of their words. She didn't ask to become legend. She didn't ask to

3950
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
ask to become legend. She didn't ask to

3951
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:53,510
ask to become legend. She didn't ask to be feared. She had simply survived. And

3952
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:53,520
be feared. She had simply survived. And

3953
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,149
be feared. She had simply survived. And survival to those in power is

3954
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:56,159
survival to those in power is

3955
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,070
survival to those in power is threatening.

3956
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:58,080
threatening.

3957
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,550
threatening. On the mainland, some whispered of her

3958
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:00,560
On the mainland, some whispered of her

3959
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,790
On the mainland, some whispered of her as more than a monster.

3960
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:02,800
as more than a monster.

3961
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,709
as more than a monster. Old women in mountain villages left

3962
01:28:04,709 --> 01:28:04,719
Old women in mountain villages left

3963
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,950
Old women in mountain villages left offerings near caves, murmuring that

3964
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
offerings near caves, murmuring that

3965
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,870
offerings near caves, murmuring that Medusa protected women who had been

3966
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:08,880
Medusa protected women who had been

3967
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,149
Medusa protected women who had been hurt. They didn't fear her. They pied

3968
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:12,159
hurt. They didn't fear her. They pied

3969
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,310
hurt. They didn't fear her. They pied her. They called her guardian of the

3970
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:14,320
her. They called her guardian of the

3971
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,350
her. They called her guardian of the wronged. But these voices were soft, and

3972
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:17,360
wronged. But these voices were soft, and

3973
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,709
wronged. But these voices were soft, and the roar of hero myths drowned them out.

3974
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:20,719
the roar of hero myths drowned them out.

3975
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,270
the roar of hero myths drowned them out. Medusa remained hidden, unaware of how

3976
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,280
Medusa remained hidden, unaware of how

3977
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,990
Medusa remained hidden, unaware of how deeply her name had split. Monster to

3978
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:26,000
deeply her name had split. Monster to

3979
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,350
deeply her name had split. Monster to some, martyr to others. What she did

3980
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:29,360
some, martyr to others. What she did

3981
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,390
some, martyr to others. What she did know was this. No matter how far she

3982
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:32,400
know was this. No matter how far she

3983
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,590
know was this. No matter how far she hid, they would keep coming. Men with

3984
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:35,600
hid, they would keep coming. Men with

3985
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,229
hid, they would keep coming. Men with swords and shining armor. Men who

3986
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:38,239
swords and shining armor. Men who

3987
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:41,590
swords and shining armor. Men who thought killing her meant glory. Men who

3988
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:41,600
thought killing her meant glory. Men who

3989
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,990
thought killing her meant glory. Men who had never cared who she was, only what

3990
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000
had never cared who she was, only what

3991
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,950
had never cared who she was, only what she had become. And somewhere a new

3992
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:46,960
she had become. And somewhere a new

3993
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,830
she had become. And somewhere a new challenger was already being born. A boy

3994
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:49,840
challenger was already being born. A boy

3995
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:53,110
challenger was already being born. A boy who would grow into a man, a hero, and

3996
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:53,120
who would grow into a man, a hero, and

3997
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,350
who would grow into a man, a hero, and her final visitor.

3998
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:55,360
her final visitor.

3999
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,669
her final visitor. While Medusa lived in exile, her legend

4000
01:28:57,669 --> 01:28:57,679
While Medusa lived in exile, her legend

4001
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,990
While Medusa lived in exile, her legend spreading like wildfire. A boy named

4002
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:00,000
spreading like wildfire. A boy named

4003
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,910
spreading like wildfire. A boy named Perseus was born to a different kind of

4004
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:01,920
Perseus was born to a different kind of

4005
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,590
Perseus was born to a different kind of silence, a prison of prophecy.

4006
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:05,600
silence, a prison of prophecy.

4007
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,669
silence, a prison of prophecy. His mother, Danier, had been locked away

4008
01:29:07,669 --> 01:29:07,679
His mother, Danier, had been locked away

4009
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,669
His mother, Danier, had been locked away in a bronze tower by her father, King

4010
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:09,679
in a bronze tower by her father, King

4011
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,390
in a bronze tower by her father, King Acryus, desperate to stop a prophecy

4012
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:12,400
Acryus, desperate to stop a prophecy

4013
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,229
Acryus, desperate to stop a prophecy that her son would one day cause his

4014
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:14,239
that her son would one day cause his

4015
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:15,910
that her son would one day cause his death.

4016
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:15,920
death.

4017
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,950
death. But the gods don't respect mortal locks.

4018
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:18,960
But the gods don't respect mortal locks.

4019
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,270
But the gods don't respect mortal locks. Zeus came to Denia, not with love, but

4020
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,280
Zeus came to Denia, not with love, but

4021
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,910
Zeus came to Denia, not with love, but as golden rain, slipping past walls and

4022
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:23,920
as golden rain, slipping past walls and

4023
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,790
as golden rain, slipping past walls and warnings. From that divine encounter,

4024
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:26,800
warnings. From that divine encounter,

4025
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,430
warnings. From that divine encounter, Perseus was born. When the king

4026
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:29,440
Perseus was born. When the king

4027
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,510
Perseus was born. When the king discovered the child, he dared not kill

4028
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:31,520
discovered the child, he dared not kill

4029
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,550
discovered the child, he dared not kill a son of Zeus directly. So he cast

4030
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:34,560
a son of Zeus directly. So he cast

4031
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,110
a son of Zeus directly. So he cast mother and infant into the sea, sealed

4032
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,120
mother and infant into the sea, sealed

4033
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,830
mother and infant into the sea, sealed in a wooden chest, a quiet execution

4034
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:39,840
in a wooden chest, a quiet execution

4035
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,110
in a wooden chest, a quiet execution wrapped in cowardice. But the sea, ruled

4036
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,120
wrapped in cowardice. But the sea, ruled

4037
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,990
wrapped in cowardice. But the sea, ruled by Poseidon, carried them not to death,

4038
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:46,000
by Poseidon, carried them not to death,

4039
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,110
by Poseidon, carried them not to death, but to refuge. They washed ashore on the

4040
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:49,120
but to refuge. They washed ashore on the

4041
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,270
but to refuge. They washed ashore on the island of Sarapos, where a fisherman

4042
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:51,280
island of Sarapos, where a fisherman

4043
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,629
island of Sarapos, where a fisherman took them in. Dier raised Perseus in

4044
01:29:54,629 --> 01:29:54,639
took them in. Dier raised Perseus in

4045
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,750
took them in. Dier raised Perseus in hiding, teaching him strength, humility,

4046
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:57,760
hiding, teaching him strength, humility,

4047
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,229
hiding, teaching him strength, humility, and the silence of survival.

4048
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:00,239
and the silence of survival.

4049
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,110
and the silence of survival. She never spoke Zeus's name. She never

4050
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:03,120
She never spoke Zeus's name. She never

4051
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,110
She never spoke Zeus's name. She never told her son what kind of god had sired

4052
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:05,120
told her son what kind of god had sired

4053
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,189
told her son what kind of god had sired him. Years passed. Perseus grew into a

4054
01:30:09,189 --> 01:30:09,199
him. Years passed. Perseus grew into a

4055
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,910
him. Years passed. Perseus grew into a sharpeyed young man, clever, strong, but

4056
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:11,920
sharpeyed young man, clever, strong, but

4057
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,470
sharpeyed young man, clever, strong, but untested. And then came the king of

4058
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:14,480
untested. And then came the king of

4059
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,030
untested. And then came the king of Sarapos, Polyctes.

4060
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:17,040
Sarapos, Polyctes.

4061
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,229
Sarapos, Polyctes. He wanted Daier for himself. Perseus

4062
01:30:20,229 --> 01:30:20,239
He wanted Daier for himself. Perseus

4063
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:22,870
He wanted Daier for himself. Perseus stood in the way. The king, feigning

4064
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:22,880
stood in the way. The king, feigning

4065
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,390
stood in the way. The king, feigning kindness, invited Perseus to a feast.

4066
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
kindness, invited Perseus to a feast.

4067
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,510
kindness, invited Perseus to a feast. Each guest was to bring a gift. Perseus,

4068
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:29,520
Each guest was to bring a gift. Perseus,

4069
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,149
Each guest was to bring a gift. Perseus, poor and proud, brought nothing.

4070
01:30:32,149 --> 01:30:32,159
poor and proud, brought nothing.

4071
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:34,950
poor and proud, brought nothing. Polyctis sneered. Then bring me the head

4072
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:34,960
Polyctis sneered. Then bring me the head

4073
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,709
Polyctis sneered. Then bring me the head of Medusa.

4074
01:30:36,709 --> 01:30:36,719
of Medusa.

4075
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:38,709
of Medusa. Laughter followed. It was meant to

4076
01:30:38,709 --> 01:30:38,719
Laughter followed. It was meant to

4077
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,870
Laughter followed. It was meant to humiliate him.

4078
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:40,880
humiliate him.

4079
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:43,669
humiliate him. But Perseus, stung by pride and unaware

4080
01:30:43,669 --> 01:30:43,679
But Perseus, stung by pride and unaware

4081
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,709
But Perseus, stung by pride and unaware of the truth behind the name, accepted.

4082
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:46,719
of the truth behind the name, accepted.

4083
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:49,830
of the truth behind the name, accepted. The gods watched with interest. Athena,

4084
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:49,840
The gods watched with interest. Athena,

4085
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,750
The gods watched with interest. Athena, perhaps still nursing guilt over what

4086
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:51,760
perhaps still nursing guilt over what

4087
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,910
perhaps still nursing guilt over what she'd done to Medusa, saw an

4088
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:53,920
she'd done to Medusa, saw an

4089
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,590
she'd done to Medusa, saw an opportunity.

4090
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:55,600
opportunity.

4091
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,629
opportunity. She would aid this boy, not for justice,

4092
01:30:58,629 --> 01:30:58,639
She would aid this boy, not for justice,

4093
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,669
She would aid this boy, not for justice, but for balance. She and Hermes came to

4094
01:31:01,669 --> 01:31:01,679
but for balance. She and Hermes came to

4095
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,950
but for balance. She and Hermes came to Perseus in dreams, whispering guidance.

4096
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:04,960
Perseus in dreams, whispering guidance.

4097
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,750
Perseus in dreams, whispering guidance. They gave him tools, winged sandals to

4098
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:07,760
They gave him tools, winged sandals to

4099
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,709
They gave him tools, winged sandals to fly, a polished shield like a mirror, an

4100
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:10,719
fly, a polished shield like a mirror, an

4101
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:13,430
fly, a polished shield like a mirror, an adamantine sword, and the helm of Hades

4102
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:13,440
adamantine sword, and the helm of Hades

4103
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,390
adamantine sword, and the helm of Hades to vanish from sight. But no gift came

4104
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:16,400
to vanish from sight. But no gift came

4105
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,430
to vanish from sight. But no gift came without purpose. Perseus had been chosen

4106
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,440
without purpose. Perseus had been chosen

4107
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,750
without purpose. Perseus had been chosen not just to kill a monster, but to

4108
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:21,760
not just to kill a monster, but to

4109
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,550
not just to kill a monster, but to complete a myth. One that began not with

4110
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:24,560
complete a myth. One that began not with

4111
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,910
complete a myth. One that began not with him, but with a girl alone in a temple,

4112
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:27,920
him, but with a girl alone in a temple,

4113
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,709
him, but with a girl alone in a temple, praying to gods who never listened.

4114
01:31:30,709 --> 01:31:30,719
praying to gods who never listened.

4115
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,030
praying to gods who never listened. Perseus set off with divine tools at his

4116
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:33,040
Perseus set off with divine tools at his

4117
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,950
Perseus set off with divine tools at his side and the weight of a king's

4118
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:34,960
side and the weight of a king's

4119
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,750
side and the weight of a king's challenge on his shoulders. But finding

4120
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:37,760
challenge on his shoulders. But finding

4121
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,750
challenge on his shoulders. But finding Medusa was not as simple as crossing

4122
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:39,760
Medusa was not as simple as crossing

4123
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,629
Medusa was not as simple as crossing land or sea. Her location had been

4124
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:42,639
land or sea. Her location had been

4125
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:44,950
land or sea. Her location had been buried by time, hidden even from the

4126
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:44,960
buried by time, hidden even from the

4127
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,910
buried by time, hidden even from the gods who had cursed her. To find her,

4128
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:47,920
gods who had cursed her. To find her,

4129
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,990
gods who had cursed her. To find her, Perseus needed answers that no mortal

4130
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:50,000
Perseus needed answers that no mortal

4131
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,709
Perseus needed answers that no mortal could give. He sought out the Gray.

4132
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:52,719
could give. He sought out the Gray.

4133
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,629
could give. He sought out the Gray. Three ancient sisters who shared a

4134
01:31:54,629 --> 01:31:54,639
Three ancient sisters who shared a

4135
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,470
Three ancient sisters who shared a single eye and a single tooth between

4136
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:56,480
single eye and a single tooth between

4137
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:59,189
single eye and a single tooth between them. They were older than gods, draped

4138
01:31:59,189 --> 01:31:59,199
them. They were older than gods, draped

4139
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,750
them. They were older than gods, draped in shadow and spite, living in the void

4140
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
in shadow and spite, living in the void

4141
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,709
in shadow and spite, living in the void between light and nightmare. They knew

4142
01:32:04,709 --> 01:32:04,719
between light and nightmare. They knew

4143
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,950
between light and nightmare. They knew where Medusa slept, for they were her

4144
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:06,960
where Medusa slept, for they were her

4145
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,470
where Medusa slept, for they were her kin.

4146
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:08,480
kin.

4147
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:12,149
kin. Perseus didn't beg. He didn't plead. He

4148
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:12,159
Perseus didn't beg. He didn't plead. He

4149
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:13,990
Perseus didn't beg. He didn't plead. He waited until one of the sisters passed

4150
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:14,000
waited until one of the sisters passed

4151
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,550
waited until one of the sisters passed the eye to another and snatched it from

4152
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:16,560
the eye to another and snatched it from

4153
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,470
the eye to another and snatched it from their hands.

4154
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
their hands.

4155
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,590
their hands. "Tell me," he demanded, holding their

4156
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:21,600
"Tell me," he demanded, holding their

4157
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,310
"Tell me," he demanded, holding their only vision hostage, or remain blind

4158
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:24,320
only vision hostage, or remain blind

4159
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,990
only vision hostage, or remain blind forever.

4160
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:26,000
forever.

4161
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,030
forever. They hissed, but they spoke. They told

4162
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
They hissed, but they spoke. They told

4163
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,590
They hissed, but they spoke. They told him of a distant island beyond mortal

4164
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:31,600
him of a distant island beyond mortal

4165
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,310
him of a distant island beyond mortal maps, past crags that tore ships to

4166
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:34,320
maps, past crags that tore ships to

4167
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,950
maps, past crags that tore ships to splinters, where stone statues littered

4168
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:36,960
splinters, where stone statues littered

4169
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,669
splinters, where stone statues littered the shores like fallen soldiers. An

4170
01:32:39,669 --> 01:32:39,679
the shores like fallen soldiers. An

4171
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,390
the shores like fallen soldiers. An island where no birds sang and no stars

4172
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:42,400
island where no birds sang and no stars

4173
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,629
island where no birds sang and no stars dared linger. The lair of Medusa. And so

4174
01:32:46,629 --> 01:32:46,639
dared linger. The lair of Medusa. And so

4175
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:49,350
dared linger. The lair of Medusa. And so Perseus flew, sandals slicing through

4176
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:49,360
Perseus flew, sandals slicing through

4177
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,470
Perseus flew, sandals slicing through clouds, heart pounding, not with fear,

4178
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:52,480
clouds, heart pounding, not with fear,

4179
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,310
clouds, heart pounding, not with fear, but anticipation.

4180
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:54,320
but anticipation.

4181
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,550
but anticipation. He saw himself returning to Sarapos with

4182
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:56,560
He saw himself returning to Sarapos with

4183
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,830
He saw himself returning to Sarapos with a head in his hands, triumphant, dier

4184
01:32:59,830 --> 01:32:59,840
a head in his hands, triumphant, dier

4185
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,750
a head in his hands, triumphant, dier proud, polyctis humbled. He did not yet

4186
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:03,760
proud, polyctis humbled. He did not yet

4187
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,870
proud, polyctis humbled. He did not yet question the story he'd been told, that

4188
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:06,880
question the story he'd been told, that

4189
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,550
question the story he'd been told, that Medusa was a monster, that she deserved

4190
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:10,560
Medusa was a monster, that she deserved

4191
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,470
Medusa was a monster, that she deserved to die.

4192
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
to die.

4193
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,310
to die. The gods had prepared him, but they had

4194
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:14,320
The gods had prepared him, but they had

4195
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,870
The gods had prepared him, but they had not warned him. They had not said that

4196
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:16,880
not warned him. They had not said that

4197
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,790
not warned him. They had not said that her cave was lined with the remains of

4198
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:18,800
her cave was lined with the remains of

4199
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,590
her cave was lined with the remains of men who called themselves heroes.

4200
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:21,600
men who called themselves heroes.

4201
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,350
men who called themselves heroes. They had not said that her eyes were not

4202
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:23,360
They had not said that her eyes were not

4203
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:26,070
They had not said that her eyes were not cruel, only cursed. and they had not

4204
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:26,080
cruel, only cursed. and they had not

4205
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,390
cruel, only cursed. and they had not said that her face beneath the serpents

4206
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:28,400
said that her face beneath the serpents

4207
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,629
said that her face beneath the serpents behind the myth still carried the shape

4208
01:33:30,629 --> 01:33:30,639
behind the myth still carried the shape

4209
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:33,430
behind the myth still carried the shape of a woman once full of faith.

4210
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:33,440
of a woman once full of faith.

4211
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,750
of a woman once full of faith. As he flew across the sea, the winds

4212
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:35,760
As he flew across the sea, the winds

4213
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,030
As he flew across the sea, the winds howled louder as if trying to speak. But

4214
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,040
howled louder as if trying to speak. But

4215
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,990
howled louder as if trying to speak. But Perseus heard only silence, a silence

4216
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:42,000
Perseus heard only silence, a silence

4217
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,709
Perseus heard only silence, a silence the gods knew well. Because when you

4218
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:44,719
the gods knew well. Because when you

4219
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,030
the gods knew well. Because when you create a monster, the last thing you

4220
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:47,040
create a monster, the last thing you

4221
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,709
create a monster, the last thing you want is for someone to hear her speak.

4222
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:50,719
want is for someone to hear her speak.

4223
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,790
want is for someone to hear her speak. When Perseus landed on the shores of the

4224
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:52,800
When Perseus landed on the shores of the

4225
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,030
When Perseus landed on the shores of the island, the world seemed to hold its

4226
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,040
island, the world seemed to hold its

4227
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:59,270
island, the world seemed to hold its breath. No breeze, no bird song, only

4228
01:33:59,270 --> 01:33:59,280
breath. No breeze, no bird song, only

4229
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,990
breath. No breeze, no bird song, only statues, hundreds of them, scattered

4230
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:02,000
statues, hundreds of them, scattered

4231
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,910
statues, hundreds of them, scattered like fallen warriors across the cliffs

4232
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:03,920
like fallen warriors across the cliffs

4233
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,790
like fallen warriors across the cliffs and crags. Their faces were twisted in

4234
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:06,800
and crags. Their faces were twisted in

4235
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,910
and crags. Their faces were twisted in terror, mouths frozen midscream, eyes

4236
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:09,920
terror, mouths frozen midscream, eyes

4237
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,950
terror, mouths frozen midscream, eyes wide with the last thing they ever saw,

4238
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:12,960
wide with the last thing they ever saw,

4239
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,910
wide with the last thing they ever saw, her. He stepped over stone limbs and

4240
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:15,920
her. He stepped over stone limbs and

4241
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,470
her. He stepped over stone limbs and shattered shields, his sword sheathed,

4242
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:18,480
shattered shields, his sword sheathed,

4243
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,510
shattered shields, his sword sheathed, his mirrored shield held tight. Athena

4244
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:21,520
his mirrored shield held tight. Athena

4245
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,350
his mirrored shield held tight. Athena had warned him, "Never look at her

4246
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:23,360
had warned him, "Never look at her

4247
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:27,270
had warned him, "Never look at her directly. Use reflection. Be swift. Be

4248
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:27,280
directly. Use reflection. Be swift. Be

4249
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,750
directly. Use reflection. Be swift. Be silent." But what the goddess hadn't

4250
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:29,760
silent." But what the goddess hadn't

4251
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,750
silent." But what the goddess hadn't said was why the statues looked not just

4252
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:31,760
said was why the statues looked not just

4253
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,030
said was why the statues looked not just terrified, but surprised. As if in their

4254
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:35,040
terrified, but surprised. As if in their

4255
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,070
terrified, but surprised. As if in their final second, they'd realized they were

4256
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:38,080
final second, they'd realized they were

4257
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,110
final second, they'd realized they were wrong. Perseus moved deeper into the

4258
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:41,120
wrong. Perseus moved deeper into the

4259
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:44,149
wrong. Perseus moved deeper into the cavern, wings folding behind him. The

4260
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:44,159
cavern, wings folding behind him. The

4261
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:46,390
cavern, wings folding behind him. The air was thick with damp moss, snake

4262
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:46,400
air was thick with damp moss, snake

4263
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,229
air was thick with damp moss, snake musk, and something else. Sorrow. The

4264
01:34:50,229 --> 01:34:50,239
musk, and something else. Sorrow. The

4265
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,629
musk, and something else. Sorrow. The serpents hissed before he saw her. A low

4266
01:34:52,629 --> 01:34:52,639
serpents hissed before he saw her. A low

4267
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:55,430
serpents hissed before he saw her. A low symphony of warning and weariness. Then

4268
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:55,440
symphony of warning and weariness. Then

4269
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,030
symphony of warning and weariness. Then she appeared, not charging, not roaring,

4270
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,040
she appeared, not charging, not roaring,

4271
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,709
she appeared, not charging, not roaring, not even aware. Medusa slept, coiled on

4272
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:02,719
not even aware. Medusa slept, coiled on

4273
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,950
not even aware. Medusa slept, coiled on a bed of stone, arms curled around

4274
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:04,960
a bed of stone, arms curled around

4275
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,910
a bed of stone, arms curled around herself like a child. Her face in the

4276
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:07,920
herself like a child. Her face in the

4277
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,669
herself like a child. Her face in the mirrored shield was peaceful, fragile. A

4278
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:11,679
mirrored shield was peaceful, fragile. A

4279
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,910
mirrored shield was peaceful, fragile. A strange beauty lingered, though her

4280
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
strange beauty lingered, though her

4281
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,510
strange beauty lingered, though her features were half hidden beneath the

4282
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:15,520
features were half hidden beneath the

4283
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,510
features were half hidden beneath the tangle of venomous serpents that rested

4284
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:17,520
tangle of venomous serpents that rested

4285
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,990
tangle of venomous serpents that rested for now in slumber.

4286
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:20,000
for now in slumber.

4287
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,310
for now in slumber. She did not look like a monster. She

4288
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:22,320
She did not look like a monster. She

4289
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,910
She did not look like a monster. She looked like someone who had been left

4290
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:23,920
looked like someone who had been left

4291
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,910
looked like someone who had been left behind.

4292
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
behind.

4293
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,070
behind. Perseus hesitated.

4294
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,080
Perseus hesitated.

4295
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,990
Perseus hesitated. This was not the roaring beast sung

4296
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:30,000
This was not the roaring beast sung

4297
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,790
This was not the roaring beast sung about in legends, not the terror painted

4298
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:32,800
about in legends, not the terror painted

4299
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,910
about in legends, not the terror painted on urns and shields. She was just a

4300
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:35,920
on urns and shields. She was just a

4301
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,950
on urns and shields. She was just a woman, cursed, asleep, and utterly

4302
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:38,960
woman, cursed, asleep, and utterly

4303
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,550
woman, cursed, asleep, and utterly alone.

4304
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:40,560
alone.

4305
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,510
alone. But the gods had given him a task. He

4306
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:43,520
But the gods had given him a task. He

4307
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,990
But the gods had given him a task. He remembered his mother. He remembered the

4308
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:46,000
remembered his mother. He remembered the

4309
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,950
remembered his mother. He remembered the mocking voice of Polyctis. He remembered

4310
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:48,960
mocking voice of Polyctis. He remembered

4311
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,149
mocking voice of Polyctis. He remembered glory. And so he raised the sword, his

4312
01:35:52,149 --> 01:35:52,159
glory. And so he raised the sword, his

4313
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,790
glory. And so he raised the sword, his eyes fixed on the mirrored shield. He

4314
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:54,800
eyes fixed on the mirrored shield. He

4315
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,310
eyes fixed on the mirrored shield. He took one step closer. A snake lifted its

4316
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:58,320
took one step closer. A snake lifted its

4317
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,750
took one step closer. A snake lifted its head. Medusa stirred, her eyes

4318
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:01,760
head. Medusa stirred, her eyes

4319
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,790
head. Medusa stirred, her eyes fluttered, still closed. She did not

4320
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:04,800
fluttered, still closed. She did not

4321
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,510
fluttered, still closed. She did not scream. She did not fight. She barely

4322
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:07,520
scream. She did not fight. She barely

4323
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,629
scream. She did not fight. She barely breathed. And in that moment, Perseus

4324
01:36:10,629 --> 01:36:10,639
breathed. And in that moment, Perseus

4325
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,950
breathed. And in that moment, Perseus struck. The blade hissed through the air

4326
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:12,960
struck. The blade hissed through the air

4327
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,470
struck. The blade hissed through the air with a divine edge. Silence followed.

4328
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:16,480
with a divine edge. Silence followed.

4329
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,149
with a divine edge. Silence followed. When her head fell into the satchel

4330
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:18,159
When her head fell into the satchel

4331
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:20,629
When her head fell into the satchel lined with bronze scales, the island

4332
01:36:20,629 --> 01:36:20,639
lined with bronze scales, the island

4333
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,310
lined with bronze scales, the island exhaled.

4334
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
exhaled.

4335
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,990
exhaled. The curse was done. Or so he thought.

4336
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,000
The curse was done. Or so he thought.

4337
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,629
The curse was done. Or so he thought. Because you can kill a body, but not a

4338
01:36:28,629 --> 01:36:28,639
Because you can kill a body, but not a

4339
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:31,669
Because you can kill a body, but not a story. And Medusa's story was just

4340
01:36:31,669 --> 01:36:31,679
story. And Medusa's story was just

4341
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,189
story. And Medusa's story was just beginning.

4342
01:36:33,189 --> 01:36:33,199
beginning.

4343
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:36,070
beginning. Perseus didn't linger. With Medusa's

4344
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:36,080
Perseus didn't linger. With Medusa's

4345
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,149
Perseus didn't linger. With Medusa's head sealed in the enchanted satchel,

4346
01:36:38,149 --> 01:36:38,159
head sealed in the enchanted satchel,

4347
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:41,189
head sealed in the enchanted satchel, its gaze still potent even in death, he

4348
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:41,199
its gaze still potent even in death, he

4349
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,830
its gaze still potent even in death, he rose into the sky, sandals beating

4350
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:43,840
rose into the sky, sandals beating

4351
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,310
rose into the sky, sandals beating against the clouds, but the silence of

4352
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:46,320
against the clouds, but the silence of

4353
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:49,030
against the clouds, but the silence of the island clung to him. Not a silence

4354
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:49,040
the island clung to him. Not a silence

4355
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:52,629
the island clung to him. Not a silence of victory, something colder. The head

4356
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:52,639
of victory, something colder. The head

4357
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,270
of victory, something colder. The head still pulsed with quiet power, though

4358
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:55,280
still pulsed with quiet power, though

4359
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,229
still pulsed with quiet power, though severed, it was not lifeless.

4360
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:58,239
severed, it was not lifeless.

4361
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,790
severed, it was not lifeless. The snakes writhed, tongues flickering,

4362
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:00,800
The snakes writhed, tongues flickering,

4363
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,510
The snakes writhed, tongues flickering, sensing the world beyond the bag. Her

4364
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:03,520
sensing the world beyond the bag. Her

4365
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,550
sensing the world beyond the bag. Her eyes remained open, unblinking, capable

4366
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:06,560
eyes remained open, unblinking, capable

4367
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,790
eyes remained open, unblinking, capable of petrifying anything that dared peer

4368
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:08,800
of petrifying anything that dared peer

4369
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,310
of petrifying anything that dared peer within.

4370
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:10,320
within.

4371
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,430
within. Perseus didn't look. He dared not. The

4372
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:13,440
Perseus didn't look. He dared not. The

4373
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,669
Perseus didn't look. He dared not. The gods had given him a weapon now, a

4374
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:15,679
gods had given him a weapon now, a

4375
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:18,310
gods had given him a weapon now, a divine trump card. But he began to feel

4376
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:18,320
divine trump card. But he began to feel

4377
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,790
divine trump card. But he began to feel uneasy carrying it. As he flew across

4378
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:20,800
uneasy carrying it. As he flew across

4379
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,950
uneasy carrying it. As he flew across the ocean, creatures of shadow stirred

4380
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:22,960
the ocean, creatures of shadow stirred

4381
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,350
the ocean, creatures of shadow stirred in the waves. For this act, though

4382
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:25,360
in the waves. For this act, though

4383
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,669
in the waves. For this act, though heroic in the mortal realm, had awakened

4384
01:37:27,669 --> 01:37:27,679
heroic in the mortal realm, had awakened

4385
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:30,950
heroic in the mortal realm, had awakened old pacts. Medusa's death had not gone

4386
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:30,960
old pacts. Medusa's death had not gone

4387
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,470
old pacts. Medusa's death had not gone unnoticed.

4388
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:32,480
unnoticed.

4389
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,709
unnoticed. Deep in the sea, her slayer had

4390
01:37:34,709 --> 01:37:34,719
Deep in the sea, her slayer had

4391
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,550
Deep in the sea, her slayer had disturbed the balance. Poseidon felt it.

4392
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:38,560
disturbed the balance. Poseidon felt it.

4393
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,629
disturbed the balance. Poseidon felt it. Athena knew it. The fates wo quietly.

4394
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
Athena knew it. The fates wo quietly.

4395
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:45,510
Athena knew it. The fates wo quietly. And far above Olympus, a storm began to

4396
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:45,520
And far above Olympus, a storm began to

4397
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,669
And far above Olympus, a storm began to gather. Still, Perseus pressed on. His

4398
01:37:49,669 --> 01:37:49,679
gather. Still, Perseus pressed on. His

4399
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,510
gather. Still, Perseus pressed on. His thoughts were consumed with what came

4400
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:51,520
thoughts were consumed with what came

4401
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,470
thoughts were consumed with what came next. He would return to Sarapos. He

4402
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:54,480
next. He would return to Sarapos. He

4403
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:57,350
next. He would return to Sarapos. He would silence King Polyctis, free his

4404
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
would silence King Polyctis, free his

4405
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,229
would silence King Polyctis, free his mother, restore his name. He would be a

4406
01:38:00,229 --> 01:38:00,239
mother, restore his name. He would be a

4407
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:04,390
mother, restore his name. He would be a hero. That's what the stories promised.

4408
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:04,400
hero. That's what the stories promised.

4409
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,229
hero. That's what the stories promised. But the weight of the satchel told

4410
01:38:06,229 --> 01:38:06,239
But the weight of the satchel told

4411
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:09,189
But the weight of the satchel told another tale. He remembered the mirrored

4412
01:38:09,189 --> 01:38:09,199
another tale. He remembered the mirrored

4413
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:11,669
another tale. He remembered the mirrored shield and the face he'd seen. She

4414
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:11,679
shield and the face he'd seen. She

4415
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:15,350
shield and the face he'd seen. She hadn't snarled. She hadn't lunged. She'd

4416
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:15,360
hadn't snarled. She hadn't lunged. She'd

4417
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,030
hadn't snarled. She hadn't lunged. She'd been sleeping.

4418
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:17,040
been sleeping.

4419
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,750
been sleeping. Was that truly a monster? Or had he

4420
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:19,760
Was that truly a monster? Or had he

4421
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,109
Was that truly a monster? Or had he killed a warning wrapped in

4422
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:21,119
killed a warning wrapped in

4423
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:23,270
killed a warning wrapped in misunderstanding?

4424
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:23,280
misunderstanding?

4425
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,750
misunderstanding? He pushed the thought aside. The gods

4426
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:25,760
He pushed the thought aside. The gods

4427
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,109
He pushed the thought aside. The gods had guided him, hadn't they? But as the

4428
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:29,119
had guided him, hadn't they? But as the

4429
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,830
had guided him, hadn't they? But as the wind howled louder, Perseus noticed

4430
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:31,840
wind howled louder, Perseus noticed

4431
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:36,070
wind howled louder, Perseus noticed something odd. The head was humming. Not

4432
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:36,080
something odd. The head was humming. Not

4433
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,830
something odd. The head was humming. Not a sound, but a sensation. As if it still

4434
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:39,840
a sound, but a sensation. As if it still

4435
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,229
a sound, but a sensation. As if it still remembered the world, as if the soul of

4436
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:42,239
remembered the world, as if the soul of

4437
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:46,149
remembered the world, as if the soul of Medusa, cursed, betrayed, mutilated,

4438
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:46,159
Medusa, cursed, betrayed, mutilated,

4439
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:49,590
Medusa, cursed, betrayed, mutilated, still looked outward, still aware, still

4440
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:49,600
still looked outward, still aware, still

4441
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,390
still looked outward, still aware, still waiting. And though Perseus would go on

4442
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:52,400
waiting. And though Perseus would go on

4443
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,109
waiting. And though Perseus would go on to slay monsters, rescue maidens, and

4444
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:55,119
to slay monsters, rescue maidens, and

4445
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,830
to slay monsters, rescue maidens, and carve his name into the stars, he would

4446
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:57,840
carve his name into the stars, he would

4447
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,149
carve his name into the stars, he would never again sleep soundly. Because

4448
01:39:00,149 --> 01:39:00,159
never again sleep soundly. Because

4449
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:02,790
never again sleep soundly. Because sometimes, at night, he swore he heard

4450
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:02,800
sometimes, at night, he swore he heard

4451
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,550
sometimes, at night, he swore he heard the faint rattle of snakes beneath his

4452
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:04,560
the faint rattle of snakes beneath his

4453
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,310
the faint rattle of snakes beneath his bed roll. And sometimes he dreamed not

4454
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:08,320
bed roll. And sometimes he dreamed not

4455
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:11,350
bed roll. And sometimes he dreamed not of victory, but of a girl kneeling in a

4456
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:11,360
of victory, but of a girl kneeling in a

4457
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,709
of victory, but of a girl kneeling in a temple, begging the gods to protect her.

4458
01:39:14,709 --> 01:39:14,719
temple, begging the gods to protect her.

4459
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,550
temple, begging the gods to protect her. Perseus returned to Sarapos with

4460
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:16,560
Perseus returned to Sarapos with

4461
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,189
Perseus returned to Sarapos with windswept hair, divine armor, and the

4462
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:19,199
windswept hair, divine armor, and the

4463
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:22,229
windswept hair, divine armor, and the head of a legend tucked under his cloak.

4464
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:22,239
head of a legend tucked under his cloak.

4465
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:24,229
head of a legend tucked under his cloak. The people greeted him with cheers,

4466
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
The people greeted him with cheers,

4467
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,390
The people greeted him with cheers, unaware of what lay in the satchel,

4468
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:26,400
unaware of what lay in the satchel,

4469
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,430
unaware of what lay in the satchel, unaware of what it had cost. But King

4470
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:29,440
unaware of what it had cost. But King

4471
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:32,310
unaware of what it had cost. But King Polyctis was no fool. He had never

4472
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:32,320
Polyctis was no fool. He had never

4473
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,790
Polyctis was no fool. He had never expected the boy to survive. His

4474
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,800
expected the boy to survive. His

4475
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,310
expected the boy to survive. His challenge had been a death sentence

4476
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:36,320
challenge had been a death sentence

4477
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,870
challenge had been a death sentence wrapped in mockery. So when Perseus

4478
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:38,880
wrapped in mockery. So when Perseus

4479
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,750
wrapped in mockery. So when Perseus stroed into the palace, head held high.

4480
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:41,760
stroed into the palace, head held high.

4481
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,750
stroed into the palace, head held high. The king's sneer quickly turned to

4482
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:43,760
The king's sneer quickly turned to

4483
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,510
The king's sneer quickly turned to unease.

4484
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:45,520
unease.

4485
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,709
unease. You brought me a gift? Polyctis mocked,

4486
01:39:48,709 --> 01:39:48,719
You brought me a gift? Polyctis mocked,

4487
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:51,590
You brought me a gift? Polyctis mocked, trying to hold on to control. Perseus

4488
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:51,600
trying to hold on to control. Perseus

4489
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:55,189
trying to hold on to control. Perseus nodded once. A token of your request.

4490
01:39:55,189 --> 01:39:55,199
nodded once. A token of your request.

4491
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,990
nodded once. A token of your request. And with that, he opened the satchel.

4492
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:58,000
And with that, he opened the satchel.

4493
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,550
And with that, he opened the satchel. For a brief second, Polyctis met the

4494
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:00,560
For a brief second, Polyctis met the

4495
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:03,830
For a brief second, Polyctis met the gaze of Medusa. Just a second. It was

4496
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:03,840
gaze of Medusa. Just a second. It was

4497
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,550
gaze of Medusa. Just a second. It was enough. Stone cracked through his skin

4498
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:06,560
enough. Stone cracked through his skin

4499
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,830
enough. Stone cracked through his skin like frost on glass. His eyes froze

4500
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:09,840
like frost on glass. His eyes froze

4501
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,149
like frost on glass. His eyes froze wide. His final breath was trapped

4502
01:40:12,149 --> 01:40:12,159
wide. His final breath was trapped

4503
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:15,189
wide. His final breath was trapped behind lips turned to granite. The king,

4504
01:40:15,189 --> 01:40:15,199
behind lips turned to granite. The king,

4505
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:18,149
behind lips turned to granite. The king, so smug, so cruel, was now nothing more

4506
01:40:18,149 --> 01:40:18,159
so smug, so cruel, was now nothing more

4507
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:21,189
so smug, so cruel, was now nothing more than a statue. The room erupted in

4508
01:40:21,189 --> 01:40:21,199
than a statue. The room erupted in

4509
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:24,550
than a statue. The room erupted in screams. Couriers fled. Some fell to

4510
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:24,560
screams. Couriers fled. Some fell to

4511
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,950
screams. Couriers fled. Some fell to their knees. Perseus remained silent,

4512
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:26,960
their knees. Perseus remained silent,

4513
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,510
their knees. Perseus remained silent, his expression unreadable. His mother,

4514
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:29,520
his expression unreadable. His mother,

4515
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,550
his expression unreadable. His mother, Dia, rushed to embrace him, finally

4516
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:32,560
Dia, rushed to embrace him, finally

4517
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,070
Dia, rushed to embrace him, finally free.

4518
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:34,080
free.

4519
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,070
free. And still, Perseus said nothing about

4520
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:36,080
And still, Perseus said nothing about

4521
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,950
And still, Perseus said nothing about the girl in the cave. To them, Medusa

4522
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:38,960
the girl in the cave. To them, Medusa

4523
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,310
the girl in the cave. To them, Medusa was a monster defeated, a tool used, an

4524
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:42,320
was a monster defeated, a tool used, an

4525
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:45,189
was a monster defeated, a tool used, an obstacle overcome. No one asked who she

4526
01:40:45,189 --> 01:40:45,199
obstacle overcome. No one asked who she

4527
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:47,990
obstacle overcome. No one asked who she had been, but Perseus remembered. The

4528
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:48,000
had been, but Perseus remembered. The

4529
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,390
had been, but Perseus remembered. The way her body fell, the way her face in

4530
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:50,400
way her body fell, the way her face in

4531
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,590
way her body fell, the way her face in the mirror had not snarled, but pleaded.

4532
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:53,600
the mirror had not snarled, but pleaded.

4533
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,149
the mirror had not snarled, but pleaded. Still the story spread quickly. Songs

4534
01:40:56,149 --> 01:40:56,159
Still the story spread quickly. Songs

4535
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:59,350
Still the story spread quickly. Songs were sung, temples raised. Perseus was

4536
01:40:59,350 --> 01:40:59,360
were sung, temples raised. Perseus was

4537
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,990
were sung, temples raised. Perseus was called Gorgon Slayer, champion of the

4538
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:02,000
called Gorgon Slayer, champion of the

4539
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,510
called Gorgon Slayer, champion of the gods, breaker of curses. They etched his

4540
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:05,520
gods, breaker of curses. They etched his

4541
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,669
gods, breaker of curses. They etched his name into marble. never once carving

4542
01:41:07,669 --> 01:41:07,679
name into marble. never once carving

4543
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,950
name into marble. never once carving hers beside it. In his later years, he'd

4544
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:10,960
hers beside it. In his later years, he'd

4545
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,430
hers beside it. In his later years, he'd placed Medusa's head on Athena's shield

4546
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,440
placed Medusa's head on Athena's shield

4547
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,070
placed Medusa's head on Athena's shield by the goddess's own command.

4548
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:16,080
by the goddess's own command.

4549
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,870
by the goddess's own command. Her face, once scorned, was now turned

4550
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:18,880
Her face, once scorned, was now turned

4551
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,070
Her face, once scorned, was now turned outward as a weapon of divine justice.

4552
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:22,080
outward as a weapon of divine justice.

4553
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,550
outward as a weapon of divine justice. But not justice for her, justice for

4554
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:24,560
But not justice for her, justice for

4555
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,470
But not justice for her, justice for others. Even in death, Medusa served.

4556
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:28,480
others. Even in death, Medusa served.

4557
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,830
others. Even in death, Medusa served. Even in silence, her power remained. And

4558
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:31,840
Even in silence, her power remained. And

4559
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,790
Even in silence, her power remained. And Perseus, the golden hero, walked beneath

4560
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:34,800
Perseus, the golden hero, walked beneath

4561
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,189
Perseus, the golden hero, walked beneath that shield for years to come. Every

4562
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:37,199
that shield for years to come. Every

4563
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,109
that shield for years to come. Every victory won with the face of the woman

4564
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:39,119
victory won with the face of the woman

4565
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:42,629
victory won with the face of the woman he had slain. He was loved. She was

4566
01:41:42,629 --> 01:41:42,639
he had slain. He was loved. She was

4567
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:45,030
he had slain. He was loved. She was feared. And neither could change the

4568
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:45,040
feared. And neither could change the

4569
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,990
feared. And neither could change the roles the gods had written for them.

4570
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:48,000
roles the gods had written for them.

4571
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,870
roles the gods had written for them. After Perseus's triumph, Athena summoned

4572
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:50,880
After Perseus's triumph, Athena summoned

4573
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,590
After Perseus's triumph, Athena summoned him to Olympus, not just to praise him,

4574
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:53,600
him to Olympus, not just to praise him,

4575
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,830
him to Olympus, not just to praise him, but to claim what had always belonged to

4576
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
but to claim what had always belonged to

4577
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:59,750
but to claim what had always belonged to her. Not the sword, nor the sandals, nor

4578
01:41:59,750 --> 01:41:59,760
her. Not the sword, nor the sandals, nor

4579
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,350
her. Not the sword, nor the sandals, nor the helm of Hades. She wanted the head,

4580
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:03,360
the helm of Hades. She wanted the head,

4581
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,590
the helm of Hades. She wanted the head, the head of Medusa.

4582
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:05,600
the head of Medusa.

4583
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,910
the head of Medusa. Perseus obeyed, offering the satchel

4584
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:07,920
Perseus obeyed, offering the satchel

4585
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,310
Perseus obeyed, offering the satchel without question. And with practiced

4586
01:42:10,310 --> 01:42:10,320
without question. And with practiced

4587
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,790
without question. And with practiced grace, Athena took the severed head of

4588
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:12,800
grace, Athena took the severed head of

4589
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,950
grace, Athena took the severed head of her former priestess, and affixed it to

4590
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:14,960
her former priestess, and affixed it to

4591
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,910
her former priestess, and affixed it to her shield, her eegis, turning it into a

4592
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:17,920
her shield, her eegis, turning it into a

4593
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,790
her shield, her eegis, turning it into a weapon of legend. The Gorgon's face,

4594
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:20,800
weapon of legend. The Gorgon's face,

4595
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,910
weapon of legend. The Gorgon's face, once radiant, once innocent, now snarled

4596
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:23,920
once radiant, once innocent, now snarled

4597
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,149
once radiant, once innocent, now snarled in frozen rage from the bronze curve of

4598
01:42:26,149 --> 01:42:26,159
in frozen rage from the bronze curve of

4599
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:29,109
in frozen rage from the bronze curve of the goddess's arm. Wherever Athena

4600
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:29,119
the goddess's arm. Wherever Athena

4601
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:32,310
the goddess's arm. Wherever Athena marched, war followed. Enemies turned to

4602
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:32,320
marched, war followed. Enemies turned to

4603
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,950
marched, war followed. Enemies turned to stone at the sight of it.

4604
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:34,960
stone at the sight of it.

4605
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,149
stone at the sight of it. Cities fell. Statues of the eegis spread

4606
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:38,159
Cities fell. Statues of the eegis spread

4607
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:40,950
Cities fell. Statues of the eegis spread across temples and coinage. Her shield

4608
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:40,960
across temples and coinage. Her shield

4609
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,910
across temples and coinage. Her shield became both warning and banner.

4610
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:43,920
became both warning and banner.

4611
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,990
became both warning and banner. But no one ever asked why Medusa had

4612
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,000
But no one ever asked why Medusa had

4613
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,870
But no one ever asked why Medusa had been cursed in the first place. Athena,

4614
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:48,880
been cursed in the first place. Athena,

4615
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:51,270
been cursed in the first place. Athena, the goddess of wisdom, carried the face

4616
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:51,280
the goddess of wisdom, carried the face

4617
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:54,470
the goddess of wisdom, carried the face of a woman she had once punished. Not as

4618
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:54,480
of a woman she had once punished. Not as

4619
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:58,070
of a woman she had once punished. Not as a reminder, not out of guilt, but as a

4620
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:58,080
a reminder, not out of guilt, but as a

4621
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,709
a reminder, not out of guilt, but as a symbol of divine power, of what happens

4622
01:43:00,709 --> 01:43:00,719
symbol of divine power, of what happens

4623
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,669
symbol of divine power, of what happens when mortals overstep. Yet some

4624
01:43:03,669 --> 01:43:03,679
when mortals overstep. Yet some

4625
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,629
when mortals overstep. Yet some whispered differently. Some said Athena

4626
01:43:06,629 --> 01:43:06,639
whispered differently. Some said Athena

4627
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,709
whispered differently. Some said Athena was not reclaiming a weapon, but

4628
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
was not reclaiming a weapon, but

4629
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,430
was not reclaiming a weapon, but granting Medusa immortality.

4630
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:11,440
granting Medusa immortality.

4631
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,750
granting Medusa immortality. That by placing her on the Aegis, she

4632
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:13,760
That by placing her on the Aegis, she

4633
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,709
That by placing her on the Aegis, she ensured Medusa would never be forgotten.

4634
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:16,719
ensured Medusa would never be forgotten.

4635
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:18,790
ensured Medusa would never be forgotten. that the girl who had once cried in her

4636
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:18,800
that the girl who had once cried in her

4637
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,990
that the girl who had once cried in her temple was now etched into eternity

4638
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:22,000
temple was now etched into eternity

4639
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,750
temple was now etched into eternity where even the gods had to carry the

4640
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:23,760
where even the gods had to carry the

4641
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,470
where even the gods had to carry the consequences of their actions.

4642
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:26,480
consequences of their actions.

4643
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,109
consequences of their actions. But the truth, the truth as always with

4644
01:43:29,109 --> 01:43:29,119
But the truth, the truth as always with

4645
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:32,629
But the truth, the truth as always with gods was layered in paradox. Athena had

4646
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:32,639
gods was layered in paradox. Athena had

4647
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:35,189
gods was layered in paradox. Athena had condemned Medusa for shaming her temple

4648
01:43:35,189 --> 01:43:35,199
condemned Medusa for shaming her temple

4649
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:37,910
condemned Medusa for shaming her temple and now she wielded that same shame as a

4650
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:37,920
and now she wielded that same shame as a

4651
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,910
and now she wielded that same shame as a trophy. The transformation was complete.

4652
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:41,920
trophy. The transformation was complete.

4653
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,229
trophy. The transformation was complete. Medusa had been a priestess, then a

4654
01:43:44,229 --> 01:43:44,239
Medusa had been a priestess, then a

4655
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:48,950
Medusa had been a priestess, then a victim, then a monster, now a weapon, an

4656
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:48,960
victim, then a monster, now a weapon, an

4657
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,990
victim, then a monster, now a weapon, an icon. And yet, somewhere in the curve of

4658
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:52,000
icon. And yet, somewhere in the curve of

4659
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,470
icon. And yet, somewhere in the curve of that sculpted jaw, in the tragic slant

4660
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:54,480
that sculpted jaw, in the tragic slant

4661
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:57,109
that sculpted jaw, in the tragic slant of her petrified eyes, something still

4662
01:43:57,109 --> 01:43:57,119
of her petrified eyes, something still

4663
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,510
of her petrified eyes, something still lived, something the world couldn't

4664
01:43:59,510 --> 01:43:59,520
lived, something the world couldn't

4665
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,030
lived, something the world couldn't unsee.

4666
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:01,040
unsee.

4667
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,870
unsee. Because even as she turned armies to

4668
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:02,880
Because even as she turned armies to

4669
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,229
Because even as she turned armies to stone, there were always a few, just a

4670
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:06,239
stone, there were always a few, just a

4671
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:09,669
stone, there were always a few, just a few, who looked upon her face and didn't

4672
01:44:09,669 --> 01:44:09,679
few, who looked upon her face and didn't

4673
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:13,270
few, who looked upon her face and didn't see a monster. They saw a question, a

4674
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:13,280
see a monster. They saw a question, a

4675
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,550
see a monster. They saw a question, a protest, a warning. And that is a power

4676
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:16,560
protest, a warning. And that is a power

4677
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,990
protest, a warning. And that is a power no blade could match. Medusa's face now

4678
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:20,000
no blade could match. Medusa's face now

4679
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,310
no blade could match. Medusa's face now stared outward from Athena's eegis,

4680
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:22,320
stared outward from Athena's eegis,

4681
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:26,229
stared outward from Athena's eegis, unblinking, eternal. To most, it was a

4682
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:26,239
unblinking, eternal. To most, it was a

4683
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:28,629
unblinking, eternal. To most, it was a symbol of divine terror, of enemies

4684
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:28,639
symbol of divine terror, of enemies

4685
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:31,109
symbol of divine terror, of enemies turned to stone, of battles won with a

4686
01:44:31,109 --> 01:44:31,119
turned to stone, of battles won with a

4687
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:33,910
turned to stone, of battles won with a single glance. But to those who looked

4688
01:44:33,910 --> 01:44:33,920
single glance. But to those who looked

4689
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,470
single glance. But to those who looked closer, that gaze held something more

4690
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:36,480
closer, that gaze held something more

4691
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:40,149
closer, that gaze held something more than fury. It held memory. It held

4692
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:40,159
than fury. It held memory. It held

4693
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:41,669
than fury. It held memory. It held injustice.

4694
01:44:41,669 --> 01:44:41,679
injustice.

4695
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:44,149
injustice. It held the truth no temple scroll ever

4696
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
It held the truth no temple scroll ever

4697
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:47,270
It held the truth no temple scroll ever dared to write. Through the centuries,

4698
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,280
dared to write. Through the centuries,

4699
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,669
dared to write. Through the centuries, warriors marched behind that shield,

4700
01:44:49,669 --> 01:44:49,679
warriors marched behind that shield,

4701
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:51,590
warriors marched behind that shield, unaware that the face they wielded once

4702
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:51,600
unaware that the face they wielded once

4703
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,350
unaware that the face they wielded once belonged to a woman who had never raised

4704
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:53,360
belonged to a woman who had never raised

4705
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,709
belonged to a woman who had never raised a hand in violence. Her curse, gifted by

4706
01:44:56,709 --> 01:44:56,719
a hand in violence. Her curse, gifted by

4707
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:59,590
a hand in violence. Her curse, gifted by the gods, had become a tool of empire.

4708
01:44:59,590 --> 01:44:59,600
the gods, had become a tool of empire.

4709
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,510
the gods, had become a tool of empire. The weaponization of her trauma was

4710
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:01,520
The weaponization of her trauma was

4711
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,550
The weaponization of her trauma was complete. Still, her eyes continued to

4712
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:04,560
complete. Still, her eyes continued to

4713
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,310
complete. Still, her eyes continued to see.

4714
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:06,320
see.

4715
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,709
see. Long after her voice had been silenced,

4716
01:45:08,709 --> 01:45:08,719
Long after her voice had been silenced,

4717
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:11,030
Long after her voice had been silenced, her gaze bore witness to a thousand

4718
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:11,040
her gaze bore witness to a thousand

4719
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,149
her gaze bore witness to a thousand battles. She watched kings rise and

4720
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:14,159
battles. She watched kings rise and

4721
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:17,510
battles. She watched kings rise and fall. She saw temples crumble and heroes

4722
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:17,520
fall. She saw temples crumble and heroes

4723
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,629
fall. She saw temples crumble and heroes turn cruel. She saw altars raised to men

4724
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:20,639
turn cruel. She saw altars raised to men

4725
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:23,430
turn cruel. She saw altars raised to men who had called her a monster and prayers

4726
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:23,440
who had called her a monster and prayers

4727
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,030
who had called her a monster and prayers whispered by women who understood what

4728
01:45:25,030 --> 01:45:25,040
whispered by women who understood what

4729
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,870
whispered by women who understood what she had lost.

4730
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:26,880
she had lost.

4731
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:29,510
she had lost. And sometimes those women left

4732
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:29,520
And sometimes those women left

4733
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,270
And sometimes those women left offerings.

4734
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:31,280
offerings.

4735
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,510
offerings. Tiny clay serpents placed at hidden

4736
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:33,520
Tiny clay serpents placed at hidden

4737
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:36,229
Tiny clay serpents placed at hidden shrines. A lock of hair wrapped in

4738
01:45:36,229 --> 01:45:36,239
shrines. A lock of hair wrapped in

4739
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:39,030
shrines. A lock of hair wrapped in cloth. A whispered name buried in the

4740
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,040
cloth. A whispered name buried in the

4741
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,229
cloth. A whispered name buried in the dark. Not out of fear,

4742
01:45:42,229 --> 01:45:42,239
dark. Not out of fear,

4743
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,390
dark. Not out of fear, but remembrance.

4744
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:44,400
but remembrance.

4745
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,149
but remembrance. Because long before Medusa became a

4746
01:45:46,149 --> 01:45:46,159
Because long before Medusa became a

4747
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:47,990
Because long before Medusa became a cautionary tale, she had been a

4748
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:48,000
cautionary tale, she had been a

4749
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,229
cautionary tale, she had been a protector. Her cave had become a

4750
01:45:50,229 --> 01:45:50,239
protector. Her cave had become a

4751
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:53,270
protector. Her cave had become a graveyard of wouldbe conquerors. Yes,

4752
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:53,280
graveyard of wouldbe conquerors. Yes,

4753
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:56,310
graveyard of wouldbe conquerors. Yes, but also a sanctuary. A place no man

4754
01:45:56,310 --> 01:45:56,320
but also a sanctuary. A place no man

4755
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,030
but also a sanctuary. A place no man could enter and survive. A place where

4756
01:45:59,030 --> 01:45:59,040
could enter and survive. A place where

4757
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,390
could enter and survive. A place where the hunted became untouchable. In time,

4758
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:02,400
the hunted became untouchable. In time,

4759
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,430
the hunted became untouchable. In time, her legend fractured. To some, she

4760
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:05,440
her legend fractured. To some, she

4761
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,149
her legend fractured. To some, she remained the Gorgon. To others, she

4762
01:46:08,149 --> 01:46:08,159
remained the Gorgon. To others, she

4763
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:10,709
remained the Gorgon. To others, she became something else entirely, a symbol

4764
01:46:10,709 --> 01:46:10,719
became something else entirely, a symbol

4765
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:13,669
became something else entirely, a symbol of resistance, a goddess of wrath and

4766
01:46:13,669 --> 01:46:13,679
of resistance, a goddess of wrath and

4767
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:16,149
of resistance, a goddess of wrath and wounded justice, a spirit that stood

4768
01:46:16,149 --> 01:46:16,159
wounded justice, a spirit that stood

4769
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:18,950
wounded justice, a spirit that stood between the powerless and the predators.

4770
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:18,960
between the powerless and the predators.

4771
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,830
between the powerless and the predators. Her myth bent and twisted as myths do,

4772
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:21,840
Her myth bent and twisted as myths do,

4773
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:25,270
Her myth bent and twisted as myths do, but the core remained. A woman wronged.

4774
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:25,280
but the core remained. A woman wronged.

4775
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,310
but the core remained. A woman wronged. A woman reshaped by pain. A woman whose

4776
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:28,320
A woman reshaped by pain. A woman whose

4777
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,870
A woman reshaped by pain. A woman whose story had been stolen, but whose stare

4778
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:30,880
story had been stolen, but whose stare

4779
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,430
story had been stolen, but whose stare could never be taken away. And so her

4780
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:33,440
could never be taken away. And so her

4781
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:36,229
could never be taken away. And so her gaze endured across paintings,

4782
01:46:36,229 --> 01:46:36,239
gaze endured across paintings,

4783
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:39,510
gaze endured across paintings, sculptures, shields, coins, and dreams.

4784
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:39,520
sculptures, shields, coins, and dreams.

4785
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,910
sculptures, shields, coins, and dreams. And in every retelling, someone new

4786
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:41,920
And in every retelling, someone new

4787
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,030
And in every retelling, someone new would pause. Someone would ask, "Was she

4788
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:45,040
would pause. Someone would ask, "Was she

4789
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,350
would pause. Someone would ask, "Was she really the monster?" And in that

4790
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:47,360
really the monster?" And in that

4791
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,550
really the monster?" And in that question, Medusa lived again. Centuries

4792
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:50,560
question, Medusa lived again. Centuries

4793
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:54,229
question, Medusa lived again. Centuries passed. Empires crumbled. New gods rose

4794
01:46:54,229 --> 01:46:54,239
passed. Empires crumbled. New gods rose

4795
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:57,750
passed. Empires crumbled. New gods rose and fell, but Medusa endured not as

4796
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:57,760
and fell, but Medusa endured not as

4797
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,070
and fell, but Medusa endured not as flesh and blood, but as symbol and

4798
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:00,080
flesh and blood, but as symbol and

4799
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,350
flesh and blood, but as symbol and shadow. Her face, chiseled into marble

4800
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:03,360
shadow. Her face, chiseled into marble

4801
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,990
shadow. Her face, chiseled into marble and cast in bronze, migrated across

4802
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:06,000
and cast in bronze, migrated across

4803
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,590
and cast in bronze, migrated across cultures. In Bzantium, in Rome, in

4804
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:09,600
cultures. In Bzantium, in Rome, in

4805
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,910
cultures. In Bzantium, in Rome, in forgotten corners of the world, her

4806
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:11,920
forgotten corners of the world, her

4807
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,990
forgotten corners of the world, her image lingered just beneath the surface

4808
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:14,000
image lingered just beneath the surface

4809
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,629
image lingered just beneath the surface of myth and memory.

4810
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:16,639
of myth and memory.

4811
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,310
of myth and memory. But something strange happened over

4812
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:18,320
But something strange happened over

4813
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,990
But something strange happened over time. The tale began to split. In one

4814
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:22,000
time. The tale began to split. In one

4815
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,629
time. The tale began to split. In one version, she remained the monster, the

4816
01:47:24,629 --> 01:47:24,639
version, she remained the monster, the

4817
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,030
version, she remained the monster, the Gorgon, the serpent-haired killer who

4818
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:27,040
Gorgon, the serpent-haired killer who

4819
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,910
Gorgon, the serpent-haired killer who turned men to stone with a glare. Her

4820
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:29,920
turned men to stone with a glare. Her

4821
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,990
turned men to stone with a glare. Her head became a talisman against evil,

4822
01:47:31,990 --> 01:47:32,000
head became a talisman against evil,

4823
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,510
head became a talisman against evil, mounted above doors, gates, and armor.

4824
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,520
mounted above doors, gates, and armor.

4825
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,750
mounted above doors, gates, and armor. Soldiers carried her into war, hoping

4826
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:37,760
Soldiers carried her into war, hoping

4827
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,910
Soldiers carried her into war, hoping her legend would strike fear deeper than

4828
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:39,920
her legend would strike fear deeper than

4829
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,030
her legend would strike fear deeper than any spear. But another story quietly

4830
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:43,040
any spear. But another story quietly

4831
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,590
any spear. But another story quietly grew alongside it, one whispered by

4832
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:45,600
grew alongside it, one whispered by

4833
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,990
grew alongside it, one whispered by poets, philosophers, and women whose

4834
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:48,000
poets, philosophers, and women whose

4835
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,109
poets, philosophers, and women whose voices rarely made it into scrolls. In

4836
01:47:51,109 --> 01:47:51,119
voices rarely made it into scrolls. In

4837
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:53,350
voices rarely made it into scrolls. In this story, Medusa was not a beast to be

4838
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:53,360
this story, Medusa was not a beast to be

4839
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,149
this story, Medusa was not a beast to be slain, but a wronged woman, punished for

4840
01:47:56,149 --> 01:47:56,159
slain, but a wronged woman, punished for

4841
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:58,629
slain, but a wronged woman, punished for beauty, cursed for a crime committed

4842
01:47:58,629 --> 01:47:58,639
beauty, cursed for a crime committed

4843
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,550
beauty, cursed for a crime committed against her.

4844
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:00,560
against her.

4845
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,750
against her. This version didn't roar, it murmured.

4846
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:03,760
This version didn't roar, it murmured.

4847
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,750
This version didn't roar, it murmured. It asked why a goddess of wisdom would

4848
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:05,760
It asked why a goddess of wisdom would

4849
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,149
It asked why a goddess of wisdom would punish her own servant, why the god of

4850
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:08,159
punish her own servant, why the god of

4851
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:10,870
punish her own servant, why the god of the sea would face no consequence, why

4852
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:10,880
the sea would face no consequence, why

4853
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,790
the sea would face no consequence, why so many men sought to kill her when she

4854
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:12,800
so many men sought to kill her when she

4855
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,270
so many men sought to kill her when she simply wanted to be left alone. In

4856
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:15,280
simply wanted to be left alone. In

4857
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,990
simply wanted to be left alone. In taverns, in libraries, in hidden corners

4858
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:18,000
taverns, in libraries, in hidden corners

4859
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,950
taverns, in libraries, in hidden corners of temples, these questions bloomed like

4860
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:20,960
of temples, these questions bloomed like

4861
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:24,310
of temples, these questions bloomed like weeds in cracks of marble. And slowly,

4862
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:24,320
weeds in cracks of marble. And slowly,

4863
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,070
weeds in cracks of marble. And slowly, the image of Medusa began to shift

4864
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:26,080
the image of Medusa began to shift

4865
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,430
the image of Medusa began to shift again. She became a mirror, not of

4866
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:29,440
again. She became a mirror, not of

4867
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:32,950
again. She became a mirror, not of terror, but of truth. Women began to see

4868
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:32,960
terror, but of truth. Women began to see

4869
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,270
terror, but of truth. Women began to see themselves in her. Survivors of

4870
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:35,280
themselves in her. Survivors of

4871
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:38,790
themselves in her. Survivors of violence, victims of silence, souls

4872
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:38,800
violence, victims of silence, souls

4873
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,550
violence, victims of silence, souls forced to wear the label of monster

4874
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:40,560
forced to wear the label of monster

4875
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,109
forced to wear the label of monster simply for being feared. Her serpents

4876
01:48:43,109 --> 01:48:43,119
simply for being feared. Her serpents

4877
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:45,109
simply for being feared. Her serpents were no longer a punishment, but a

4878
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:45,119
were no longer a punishment, but a

4879
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:48,550
were no longer a punishment, but a crown. Her eyes not a curse, but a

4880
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:48,560
crown. Her eyes not a curse, but a

4881
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,510
crown. Her eyes not a curse, but a defense sharpened by betrayal. Even now,

4882
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,520
defense sharpened by betrayal. Even now,

4883
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,229
defense sharpened by betrayal. Even now, in modern tales and art, Medusa rises

4884
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:54,239
in modern tales and art, Medusa rises

4885
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:58,229
in modern tales and art, Medusa rises again, not to petrify, but to testify.

4886
01:48:58,229 --> 01:48:58,239
again, not to petrify, but to testify.

4887
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:00,390
again, not to petrify, but to testify. She stares from paintings with grief and

4888
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:00,400
She stares from paintings with grief and

4889
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:03,990
She stares from paintings with grief and fury. Her story is retold not to glorify

4890
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,000
fury. Her story is retold not to glorify

4891
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,629
fury. Her story is retold not to glorify Perseus, but to ask why he was called a

4892
01:49:06,629 --> 01:49:06,639
Perseus, but to ask why he was called a

4893
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:10,070
Perseus, but to ask why he was called a hero at all, because myths evolve. And

4894
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:10,080
hero at all, because myths evolve. And

4895
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,910
hero at all, because myths evolve. And sometimes the monster is not the one

4896
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:11,920
sometimes the monster is not the one

4897
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,390
sometimes the monster is not the one with fangs, but the one holding the

4898
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,400
with fangs, but the one holding the

4899
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,950
with fangs, but the one holding the sword. And in every generation that

4900
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:16,960
sword. And in every generation that

4901
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,750
sword. And in every generation that dares to question the old story,

4902
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:19,760
dares to question the old story,

4903
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,830
dares to question the old story, Medusa blinks just once and watches them

4904
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:23,840
Medusa blinks just once and watches them

4905
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,320
Medusa blinks just once and watches them begin to understand.
